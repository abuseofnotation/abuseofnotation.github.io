The Business of Credibility
==

Credibility greatly influences all of our choices, but the primal way of gaining credibility is not to “show and prove”, it is someone else who already has it to give it to you. The goal of this article is to show how dumb this concept is, and how we can fix that.

If I have to describe my life up to my early twenties I'd say it is one big waste. School, university, internships. These are steps that we all have to go through before we even start doing real work. They say these institutions prepare us for real life, but they take also away some of the most productive years from it, while doing so. And if we can’t or don’t want to work the thing we studied for, we have to "start all over again".

Why would someone spend an enormous amount of money and devote half of his life just to acquire some reputation instead of actually practicing his art and getting better at it. The answer, for many people, is to view reputation as a good. To recognize that if they "buy" enough of it, via attending elite universities or working for famous companies, they might be in a position to sell it and make a ton of money. Someone sold us the idea that if you are credible, you don’t really have to work, and now that is a fact in our society. 

But hear this: you can also become credible without working. Those two facts add up to a society in which real skills are often marginalized and industries in which it is not immediately apparent who is capable and who is not, are dominated by people who "played their cards right", often without ever having to do real work. Yep, these are the people that your kids will be studying from. This is only part of the problem, though.

Original ideas are not credible

Even if the folks at the university are very wise and the folks who run big-ass companies are indeed the cream of the crop, they are still just people. Which means they are subjective i.e. they sometimes tend to be ignorant and they are more or less biased towards the way a given problem can be approached. You became credible by getting the approval of these people. But, like I said, they are just people so they won’t give it to you just because you are as good as them: you will have to become *like* them.

That is how stereotypes were born: if someone wants to amount to something in the professions, he must first learn to look and act like the people who work in his field. If he wants to be a lawyer he has to wear a suit. If he wants to program, he must wear glasses and be a fan of science fiction. Also (and this may be the worst of all predjudice) he better be a man.

I will give you a meta example: When I started writing this essay at first I spend a lot of time trying to think of a witty and original way to open it. Why? Because writers are be witty. They cannot just straightforwardly state their ideas and views on the subject.

The better way

Some people might say “We know that what you are saying is partly true, but we just need some kind of standards to decide who to trust.” My answer to them is 1) the current standards you have are lousy and 2) we don’t need standards at all. We can decide based on the task and the person’s qualification for it instead of just assuming that credible people are good at everything and non-credible people are morons. Because we are all morons.

I will go even further by stating that most of us already have an idea of whether a given person will be up for a task or not. The problem (now I realize this) is that we do not trust our own judgement. We go and ask someone who we think is an expert. This is convenient because we do not have to think about the decision, we don’t have to take responsibility for the imminent failures that it will lead to (“I asked him and he told me to do it. What do you want?”), but isn’t convenience just another word for mediocrity?
