This is just a short post that aims to show that determinism and free will are totally compatible with one another.

Preamble
===

If you have never seen this debate, you way understand what's going on is to watch a bunch of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=free+will+determinism), or by reading this short section right here.

My definition of determinism:

> Determinism is the idea that there exist a function/formula that accepts the current state of the universe, as an argument and that outputs the state of the universe at some later or earlier time. 

This principle *seems* true (at least in the smaller-scale), but the main reason it gets so much attention is that all of science is based on it (after all, science is all about verification which is predicting the outcome of some experiments and natural phenomena). 

The personification of this idea is a theoretical creature known as Laplace's Demon. I talked about this creature in my post about [/22-02-05-universal-knowledge](universal knowledge). It is a creature who somehow acquired this function and also the state of the universe at one time and is smart enough to compute all states of the universe, therefore it knows everything. 

> We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes. --- Pierre Simon Laplace, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities

And if you consider this view for scales that are larger than individual atoms, but yet smaller than stars and planets, it follows that Laplace's Demon can predict the behavior of *people* i.e. it knows what are you going to do yesterday and the day after, it even knows what the contents of your brain would be and for this reason you don't have free will.

There are a whole bunch of physical considerations regarding the existence of Laplace's Demon, the most serious of which is that quantum physics is not deterministic, but I won't go into these, as I see a simpler way to call out the paradoxes that it's existence would lead to.

A proof that Laplace’s Demon cannot exist in this universe 
===

Here is the proof that I have in mind - if Laplace’s Demon exists, then its mind must contain within itself a representation of all the universe e.g. if it is a regular brain, it has to have a neuron for each particle of the universe, if it is a computer, it must have a memory cell for each particle etc. But Laplace’s Demon is itself part of this universe, therefore it must contain a representation of itself, which leads to infinite regress --- the representation of itself has to contain a representation of the universe which must contain a representation of itself and so on.

Furthermore, assume that Laplace's demon is able to do it's stuff in some parallel universe, but that I am able to get a hold of Laplace’s Demon’s computations. If so I can find the part where he says what I will do next and do something else. I can do that because the computation deterministic i.e. fixed.

What does this proof mean
===

So we didn't prove that Laplace’s Demon cannot exist at all, but we proved that it can only exist if it:

1. Lives outside this universe.
2. Nobody from this universe has access to its readings.

That, in my opinion, makes Laplace’s Demon Not Very Interesting. This is so, because it shows that Laplace's demon cannot be an *agent* in the universe the behavior of which it is predicting. If it exists, Laplace's Demon would just be *another universe*. Computing the state of the world one second from now would amount to one second passing in our universe. Because of this, if Laplace's demon exists and is reading this text (if it exist it has to be reading it), I would give it the following piece of advice: 

> Dear Laplace's Demon, 
>
Seems that you are so powerful and that you have a whole universe at your disposal, I don't see you are bothering with computing all the future states of the universe manually. Instead, just arrange a couple of trillion atoms in your universe in the same way as they are arranged in ours and watch the magic happening. I mean, why would you create a representation of our universe, with all its overheat, when you can just create a copy of it. 

But even if Laplace's Demon doesn't follow this advice, the universe inside it just be a *copy* of our universe with no particular criteria making one of them more *real* than the other.

Conclusion
===

So, does the fact that there may exist another (simulated?) universe that is an exact copy of our universe, where there is another version of me who is doing exactly what I am doing, mean that I don’t have free will? No, I am freely making all of my decisions, it is just that the decisions that I am making happen (quite unsurprisingly) to be the same as the ones that the “other me” is making. That does not make my (our) decisions free. 

PS Iegor Reznikof proved a [similar result in a similar manner](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2945v3) in 2012.
