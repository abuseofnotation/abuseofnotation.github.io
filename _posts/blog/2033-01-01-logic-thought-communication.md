Self-communication
===

I think that communication works in the same way when it happens between different areas of one and the same system of systems i.e. in the mind of the same agent. 


Thoughts and communication
===

We tend to think of logical pictures as existing in an individual first and being transferred second, but it makes a lot of sense for things to be reversed - that is that communication enables us to be logical.


The dark side of the mind
===

In contrast with the part (or parts) of the mind that we are able to pinpoint and describe with logical pictures that we can use to enlighten the others, there is also the part that is indescribable, the part whose internals are hidden even to us. The *dark side of the mind* is not dark in the sense of the dark side in Star Wars i.e. evil, but rather in the sense of the *dark side of the moon* (mysterious, unseen).

Right off the bat, I want to say that I don't think that the dark side has a different modus operandi than the light one, that is, I think that it, like it is also just as logical 

Appendix: Feelings are a stronger form of knowledge
===

Folks who are good at something, be it basketball, chess, programming or anything else cannot fully explain how do they do the thing they do, even to people who are equally good at the same thing. i.e. I cannot determine if someone is a good programmer just by talking to them.

This goes to show that huge part of what we call knowledge is not expressible in words or any other kind of language. Moreover, it is this inexpressible part that is actually the deeper, more important one, the expressible part is just the tip of the iceberg.

Even if the theory is perfect and even if you know it perfectly, you have to know how to map it in diverse set of circumstances. The theory itself cannot tell you this, this is the realm of feelings.

And (even though it may come last when you are learning a theory) the feeling is what comes *first* to for person who creates the theory - they have a *feeling* about a given phenomenon, and then they articulate some of it in a theory. 

Many people say that thrusting the way we feel is irrational, they donâ€™t realize that feelings are also knowledge, just one that we cannot express in a way that makes sense for others. Thrust your feelings.

And there is another point I can make regarding this, related to learning. Learning a given theory has nothing to do with memorizing it, learning means feeling a similar feeling than the creator of the theory did (or having the same *intuition* as they did, to use a more familiar word, (which means the same thing)). A theory is a work of art, like a novel or a symphony. Good theories resonate with a lot of people, just like any good art.

So science and mathematics  is art - this is not so obvious when studying math at an elementary level, because the feeling/intuition is mostly already there for you (as it is with elementary art, like folklore, for example) and you just have to memorize the language/notation, but it is obvious when studying more advanced theories that require more dedication.

For example, memorizing the type signature that defines what a monad  is, even if you understand it perfectly would not teach you what a monad is (although it is a good first step).

```
return :: a -> m a
(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

Learning what a monad is, means feeling a given feeling. And, this is why, there is no straightforward way to explain what a monad is. This is why everyone approaches it (explaining monads) differently and still no explanation is completely correct.

This is why for a layperson, reading a math textbook is often unnerving and unpleasant, in the same way as a child who never experienced romantic love, would find reading love stories (or any other book for grown-ups) unpleasant. 

But once it "clicks" it suddenly makes sense - everyone knows that, but many don't realize that this clicking has nothing to do with memorization, it is just the experience of a feeling.
