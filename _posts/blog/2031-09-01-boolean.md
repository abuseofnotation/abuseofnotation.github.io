The case against boolean thinking
===

In my last post about generality, I wanted to show how our ambition to discover ideas that are all-encompassing and eternal makes our whole worldview crumble, leaving us unable to think clearly even about very simple issues with obvious solutions. Today I want to talk about instance of the same thing, in a way that is simpler and more direct. You can think of this essay as a prequel to the longer and more developed "When generality fails".

What is boolean thinking
===

Every time someone asks you a yes/no question, you are being cohersed into accepting a thinking pattern that we will call *boolean, thinking*. The word "boolean" here is used in the sense of the boolean datatype in logic and programming - it is a type that is inhabited by just two values, which we call *true* and *false*. And so by boolean thinking, I am refering to the precondition that every statement should necessarily be categorized as either true or false.

"But every statement *is* true or false." some of us might object. This principle might not be entirely false, but it is also not entirely true :) . Let's review some situations in which it fails:

1. A statement might be *somewhat true and somewhat false*. Anything more abstract and more complex is rarely a binary, i.e. if I ask you if someone is a good person or not you might be more comfortable with representing your answer by a percentage, than a simple boolean value.

2. A statement might be *unknown/unknowable*. There are things that we don't know and even ones that we *cannot know*, and therefore questions that cannot be answered.

3. A statement might be *senseless*. Not every question is meaningful. Asking for a yes/no answer is depriving people from the option to call out a given question as not making sense.

And let's not forget also that the sense, the context of which a statement is true or false also matters for its "evaluation" - a statement can be true in one context and false in another one, every statement is senseless without a context, and unknown with incomplete context.

You are probably aware of all those situations (or at least they are not entirely unknown to you), but you still don't think that they contradict the boolean doctrine (as we shall see later boolean thinking is exactly that - a doctrine.) Boolean is a mode of thinking which, although not universally valid, is very helpful in most occasions e.g. you cannot make plans for tonight with someone who says that there is 40% chance they are going out, or who cannot answer the question whether they are going out, or they say that it does not make sense for them. For this reason you might be tempted to dub all imperfections of the boolean model as imperfections of the world and the thinking beings:

1. A statement is *somewhat true and somewhat false* only because a person cannot make their mind, or does not know enough in order to give a definite answer.

2. No statement is *unknown/unknowable* - somewhere out there there is an answer.

3. No statement is *senseless*, all statements can be interpreted, given enough effort.

I diagnose people who have such symptoms as having serious case of *boolean thinking*. But don't worry, the desease is entirely curable, provided that you understand its cause. And the cause of boolean thinking always has to do with a question that we already examined - the question of *context*.

All about context
===

In logic, the truth or falsity of a statement is always determined by  its context i.e. by the statements that we accept as true or false in order to justify it. In the boolean thinking patterns described above, *context is always impricit* - we assume that we all agree on some universal doctrine (or a universal set of statements that are true) based on which we can evaluate every statement. Note that aside from being universal (valid for all statements) this doctrine has to also be *all-encompassing* (relevant for  every statement) in order for the logic to be valid, i.e. boolean logics depend on an *autoritarian doctrines*. For me this rule admits no exceptions, for the simply because the word *authoritarian* is defined in presicely this way, and it is precisely these qualities that make up for all other connotations of this word. And it is due to these characteristics that authoritarian regimes past and present work the way they do - this is why expert historians often say that the real problem with authoritarian regimes is not in doctrines on which they are based on but their desire and insistence to establish these doctrines as universal and all-encompassing i.e. boolean. This is also why *propaganda* is so vital for these regimes to stay in power (what I call "boolean thinking" is sometimes called black-or-white thinking in this context, by the way.)

Why (not) boolean thinking
===

But let's go back to the subject of logic and summarize what we talked about so far:
1. A boolean statement is a sentence that is designated to be either true or false. 
2. A doctrine, a framework for thinking, where all statements are boolean we called boolean framework. 
3. Boolean frameworks are *authoritarian*, that is, one framework cannot coexist with another one without leading to logical paradoxes.

So while boolean logic may be splendid when viewed by itself, when viewed in relation to the "real world" there is a huge issue with it, the namely that no logical framework is strong enough to capture the things that we usually want to dissect, the real-world if we must. Proving the claim above is a subject of a different text, for now it suffices to say that althoug it may not look logical or scientific, but is, however, very strongly backed up by both logic and science. So strongly, that it is more appropriate to ask what makes us think the reverse, that the real world may be captured by a boolean logical framework - I'd argue that the thought that it can be is an instance of the so called "is-ought" falacy - the idea that something is true just because it will be good for us that it is true. 

When a "boolean thinker" encounters an event that does not obey a their boolean framework of choice, they have two courses of action that they can take:

1. Pretend that it didn't happen, (or try to alter their perception of it to fit it there.
2. Declare that "the world is not logical" and stop making sense of it.

In contrast, non-boolean thinking for many different frameworks to co-exist in a way that is not diminitive to any of them.
