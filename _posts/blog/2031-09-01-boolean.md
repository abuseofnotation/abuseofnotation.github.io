The case against boolean thinking
===

In my last post about generality, I wanted to show how our ambition to discover ideas that are all-encompassing and eternal makes our whole worldview crumble, leaving us unable to think clearly even about very simple issues with obvious solutions. Today I want to talk about instance of the same thing, in a way that is simpler and more direct. You can think of this essay as a prequel to the longer and more developed "When universality breaks".

What is boolean thinking
===

Every time someone asks you a yes/no question, you are being cohersed into accepting a thinking pattern that we will call *boolean, thinking*. The word "boolean" here is used in the sense of the boolean datatype in logic and programming - it is a type that is inhabited by just two values, which we call *true* and *false*. By boolean thinking, I am refering to the precondition that every statement should necessarily be categorized as either true or false.

"But every statement *is* true or false." some of us might object. This principle might not be entirely false, but it is also not entirely true (badum-ts). Let's go through some examples:

1. A statement might be *somewhat true and somewhat false*. Anything more abstract and more complex is rarely boolean, i.e. if I ask you if someone is a good person or not you might be more comfortable with representing your answer by a percentage.

2. A statement might be *unknown/unknowable*. There are things that we don't know and even ones that we *cannot know*, and therefore there are questions that cannot be answered by yes and no.

3. A statement might be *senseless*. Not every question is meaningful. Asking for a yes/no answer is depriving people from the option to call out a given question as not making sense.

You are probably aware of all those situations, but you still don't think that they contradict the boolean doctrine (as we shall see later boolean thinking is exactly that - a doctrine.) Boolean is a mode of thinking which, although not universally valid, is very helpful in most occasions e.g. you cannot make plans for tonight with someone who says that there is 40% chance they are going out, or who cannot answer the question whether they are going out, or they say that it does not make sense for them. For this reason you might be tempted to dub all imperfections of the boolean model as imperfections of the world and the thinking beings:

1. A statement is *somewhat true and somewhat false* only because a person cannot make their mind, or does not know enough in order to give a definite answer.

2. No statement is *unknown/unknowable* - somewhere out there there is an answer.

3. No statement is *senseless*, all statements can be interpreted, given enough effort.

I diagnose people who have such symptoms as having serious case of *boolean thinking*. But don't worry, the desease is entirely curable, provided that you understand its cause. And the cause of boolean thinking always has to do with the question of *context*, as in general, *the context* of which a statement is expressed matters for its "evaluation" to true and false

1. Each statement can *be true in one context and false in another one*.
2. Every statement is senseless when presented *without context*, 
3. Every statement is unknown when the context is *incomplete.*

Boolean thinking and authoritarian doctrines
===

We established that the truth or falsity of a statement is always determined by its context i.e. by the statements that we accept as true or false in order to justify it. So boolean thinking is possible only if we agree on some universal context (or a universal set of statements that are true) based on which we can evaluate every statement. 

Note that aside from being universal (valid for all statements) this doctrine has to also be *all-encompassing* (relevant for every statement) in order for the logic to be valid, i.e. boolean logic is possible only under what is called *autoritarian doctrine*, although that phrase (authoritarian doctrines) is somewhat deceiving, because it isn't the doctrines themselves that are authoritarian, but the role they play in people's thinking patterns. 

So while boolean logic may be splendid when viewed by itself, when viewed in relation to the "real world" there is a huge issue with it, the namely that *no logical framework is strong enough to capture the things that we usually want to dissect*, (the real world if we must.) Proving the claim above is a subject of a different text, for now it suffices to say that although it may not look logical or scientific, it is, however, very strongly backed up by both logic and science. So strongly, that it is more appropriate to ask what makes us think the reverse, that the real world may be captured by a boolean logical framework - I'd argue that the thought that it can be is an instance of the so called "is-ought falacy"- the idea that something is true just because it will be good for us that it is true. 

Boolean VS non-boolean thinking
===

When a "boolean thinker" encounters an event that does not obey a their boolean framework of choice, they have two courses of action that they can take:

1. Pretend that it didn't happen, (or try to alter their perception of it to fit it there.
2. Declare that "the world is not logical" and stop making sense of it.

In contrast, thinking in a non-boolean manner allows for many different frameworks to co-exist in a way that is not diminitive to any of them. 


Summary
---

When most people think of logic, they think of classical or *boolean*  logic, i.e. logic in which a proposition can be either true or false (law of the excluded middle). Some (e.g. your readers) are aware that there are other types of logic, but they are largely regarded as exotic curiosities, rather than real alternatives to traditional boolean logic.

There is, however, a branch of non-boolen logic, called *intuitionistic* or constructive logic, that is getting increasingly more popular and relevant to many areas of research. It is, for example, the logic that is at the heart of the so called "proof assistants" - computer programs that assist the process of proving mathematical theorems and verify that the end result is free of errors. Intuitionistic logic is based on the concept of a "proof" - an algorithm for that a given statement is "true", based on other statements. Here instead of 2 cases (true/false), there are 3: there may exist a proof that the statement is true, there might exist a proof that it is false, or neither proofs might exist, in which case the statement is neither true nor false.

The case against boolean logic has to do with the fact that it inspires dichotomous thinking, also known as black-and-white thinking --- presenting a senseless proposition and asking people to say if it's true or false confuses them in a way that also makes them susceptible and it is a common propaganda technique. 

This is because boolean logic  overlooks the importance of context - each proposition can be true/false in one context, and senseless in another - it is this option that is often forgotten.

My article would explain how intuitionistic logic works and would show how it can be used to refine our thinking to guard us from such fallacies and "thought traps".
