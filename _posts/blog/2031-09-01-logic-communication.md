title: "How does knowledge work: using logic to model real-world communication"
layout: blog

> Hello and welcome to the moment that you (all two of you) have been waiting for - the second installment of "How does knowledge work". This is exciting right? Riight? OK, at least it might be benefitial for you. So this time we will examine how people communicate. And I mean communicate in the broadest sense, from spoken communication to written or drawn, from informal to formal (in the sense of logically formal). We will look into all of that and we will present a whole theory of how communication happens that is based on [the first installment of "How does knowledge work"](/logic-thought). You remember that, right? Right? Oh, OK, I better start a little earlier.

A summary of what we said in the previous part
===

In the [previous installment](/logic-thought), we claimed that the way we think is inherently logical i.e. it is formal. Then we asked the question: But how, then it manages to be so impresice for example every person has thoughts that contradict one another, or opinions that are not boolean? We saw that the best way to answer this question is to postulate that human thought is not based on not one but multiple axiomatic systems which work in parralel to one another and in some cases compete, forming what we called the *system of systems* (or *metasystem* as we will call it here.)

A system that is connected to two other systems (by different sets of assertions). Subsets of (true) statements in the system below are connected by a morphism to subsets of the statements the systems above. Thus the statements in the systems above are axioms in this context.

We can view those systems as, for example, viewpoints that we are considering when making a decision each of which carries some weight in the final result, using what we called *levels of relevance* to a given problem. And we mentioned two ways in which these levels of relevance are determined one by elementary positive response from the body and two, from family resemblance to each other.

In this installment, we will see that not only our thinking, but our communication is formal as well, and that perhaps, it is that very ability (to communicate) which makes our thinking formal.

What is communication - transfering systems between metasystems
===

If we view systems as something like *viewpoints* then communication between people would involve transfering those viewpoints from one person to another, or transfering those systems from one metasystem to another (there may be other kinds of communication this is the one that we will be looking at here.) As we all know, this transfer does not happen directly mind-to-mind (and we will see later why it *cannot ever* happen directly), but through a representation which we will call *picture*, as per Wittgenstein's Tractatus.

A picture need not be a literal Hasse diagram (although, as we shall see later, Hasse diagrams have certain benefits.) It may be expressed in text, video, conversation or any other media, what defines the picture of a system is just this - it contains a system within itself (at least that is intended by its creator.)

Let's get a real-life example: we are sitting in a bar. I am going to get drinks for you and so I ask you what do you want. You tell me something and I get a drink for you based on your response. 

Fuziness
---

Your mental process for choosing what to drink is logical (let's say) and the method I get from your description is also logical. But that does not mean that they are the same. This is an essential quality of almost all communication it tends to be fuzzy i.e. what you think is not what I think.
