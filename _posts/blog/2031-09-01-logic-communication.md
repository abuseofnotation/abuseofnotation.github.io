And I mean communicate in the broadest sense, from spoken communication to written or drawn, from informal to formal (in the sense of logically-formal). We will look into all of that and we will present a whole theory of how communication happens that is based on [the first installment of "How does knowledge work"](/logic-thought) where we basically established a logical framework for modelling how the human mind works.

Oh, you don't care? Well, listen up, it's actually interesting. Plus what better things you have to do, communicate with *actual people*? OK, cool, but listen up, how would you know that you are actually communicating with them, if you are not familiar with the logical foundations of human communication?

Understanding communication is key to understanding our thought process - the only thoughts that we are sure we have, are the ones that we can communicate in some way to other people, or at least to ourselves. But at the same time communication sometimes feel very unreliable and error-prone and - the person whom you are speaking gets *somewhat* what we are saying, they (with the exception of some very trivial cases) never get it quite right.

What is a logical system. A summary of the previous article
===

In the [previous installment](/logic-thought) of this series, we claimed that the way we think is inherently logical i.e. it is formal. Then we asked the question: But how, then it manages to be so impresice for example every person has thoughts that contradict one another, or opinions that are more complex than simple yes/no. We saw that the best way to answer this question is to postulate that human thought is based on not one but multiple axiomatic systems that work in parralel, and in some cases compete, forming what we called the *system of systems* (or *metasystem* as we will call it here.)

A system that is connected to two other systems (by different sets of assertions). Subsets of (true) statements in the system below are connected by a morphism to subsets of the statements the systems above. Thus the statements in the systems above are axioms in this context.

</figure>

We said that we can view those systems as mental representations or explanations that we are considering when making a decision each of which carries some weight in the final result, using what we called *levels of relevance* to a given problem. 

Finally, we mentioned two ways in which these levels of relevance are determined: 
1. By elementary positive response from the body (e.g. instincts)
2. From family resemblance with systems that are already established as "true".

In this installment, we will see that not only the way we think, but the way we communicate is formal as well, and that perhaps it is that very ability (to communicate) which makes our thinking formal.

Systems as viewpoints
---

Systems are explanation of something. In the previous installment we thought of them as *mental images* (means to explain somethig to ourselves), but in the context of communication they are more like *viewpoints* (means to explaion something to other people). If you examine the two concepts closely, you will see that the difference is only superficial - a mental image at first belongs in the brain of a given person, but if it is shared by them with different people, the image becomes their viewpoint (although one person can have multiple viewpoints.)

What is communication 
===

If we view systems as something like *viewpoints* then communication between people would involve transfering those viewpoints from one person to another, or, more formally, transfering those systems from one metasystem to another (you might argue that there are other kinds of communication this is the one that we will be looking at here.) As we all know, this transfer does not happen directly mind-to-mind (and we will see later why it *cannot ever* happen directly), but through a representation which we will call *picture*, as per Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-philosophicus.

Viewpoint Pictures
---

A logical system/viewpoint can be represented and thought of as a *Hasse diagram* (that is a set of points that are connected by arrows.) A picture of a system, then, is any object that represents the structure of such diagram.

A picture need not be a literal Hasse diagram (although, as we shall see later, literal Hasse diagrams have certain benefits.) It may be expressed in text, video, conversation or any other media. What defines the picture of a system is just the fact that it contains a system within itself in some way (at least that is intended by its creator.)

Immediately we can split pictures in two main categories - formal and non-formal (fuzzy) pictures. A working definition: formal are the pictures where the creator has a Hasse diagram of what they want to represent in their mind, and non-formal, ones where they do not. Note that a formal picture *might* be misunderstood (but a non-formal one is (at some sense) *always* misunderstood.

To undderstand the distinction better, consider this real-life example: we are sitting in a bar. I am going to get drinks for you and so I ask you what do you want and you reply the following:

> Get me a beer, low alcoholic one, if there isn't such, or if it's very expensive, I just want a box of water.

You notice that your response describes your wishes in a way that would allow the listener to replicate your thinking process in a way that would guarantee that they would always reach the exact same conclusion that you intended them to reach. This is what we mean when we say that it is *formal*. 

And it is my thesis (which is probably some corrolary of the very famous thesis by Church and Turing) that it having these qualities implies that my response can be represented by a Hasse diagram.

<figure>

A Hasse diagram, representing the logical picture, that is also represented by the sentence:

> Get me a beer, low alcoholic one, if there isn't such, or if it's very expensive, I just want a box of water.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

For completeness sake, here is an example of a non-formal response - one that is fuzzy and allows room for interpretation:

> I don't know, perhaps some white wine, or a cocktail. I fancy something fresh with some strong flavour.

Such response cannot be represented by a Hasse diagram and so it puts thrust to the listener to fill the blanks.

Viewpoint Contexts
---

Does the existence of formal pictures imply that our communication can be completely formal? No. To see why, let's examine our formal picture and see that a lot of it's constituents (i.e. a lot of points in the Hasse diagram) are not precisely defined.

> Get me a beer, *low alcoholic* one, if there isn't such, or if it's *very expensive*, I just want a box of water.

We see that these can easily be made more presice, but they cannot ever be made *completely precise*.

Fuziness
---

Your mental process for choosing what to drink is logical (let's say) and the method I get from your description is also logical. But that does not mean that they are the same. This is an essential quality of almost all communication it tends to be fuzzy i.e. what you think is not what I think.
