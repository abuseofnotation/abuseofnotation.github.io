> Hello and welcome to the moment that you (all two of you) have been waiting for - the second installment of "How does knowledge work". This is exciting right? Riight? 

We all communicate, or at least we think we do. And I mean communicate in the broadest sense, from spoken communication to written or drawn, from informal to formal (in the sense of logically-formal). We will look into all of that and we will present a whole theory of how communication happens that is based on [the first installment of "How does knowledge work"](/logic-thought) where we basically established a logical framework for modelling how the human mind works.

> You remember that, right? Right? Well, maybe the *reason* you fell asleep was that you actually were more interested in how people communicate with one another. Could this be it?  Oh, you don't care? Well, listen up, it's actually interesting. Plus what better things you have to do, communicate with *actual people*? OK, cool, but listen up, how would you know that you are actually communicating with them, if you are not familiar with the logical foundations of human communication?

I believe that understanding communication is key to understanding our thought process - the only thoughts that we are sure we have, are the ones that we can communicate in some way to other people, or at least to ourselves. But at the same time communication sometimes feel very unreliable and error-prone and - the person whom you are speaking gets *somewhat* what we are saying, they (with the exception of some very trivial cases) never get it quite right.

What is a system. A summary of the previous article
===

In the [previous installment](/logic-thought) of this series, we claimed that the way we think is inherently logical i.e. it is formal. Then we asked the question: But how, then it manages to be so impresice for example every person has thoughts that contradict one another, or opinions that are more complex than simple yes/no. We saw that the best way to answer this question is to postulate that human thought is based on not one but multiple axiomatic systems which work in parralel to one another and in some cases compete, forming what we called the *system of systems* (or *metasystem* as we will call it here.)

A system that is connected to two other systems (by different sets of assertions). Subsets of (true) statements in the system below are connected by a morphism to subsets of the statements the systems above. Thus the statements in the systems above are axioms in this context.

We can view those systems as, mental representations or explanations that we are considering when making a decision each of which carries some weight in the final result, using what we called *levels of relevance* to a given problem. And we mentioned two ways in which these levels of relevance are determined one by elementary positive response from the body and two, from family resemblance to each other.

In this installment, we will see that not only our thinking, but our communication is formal as well, and that perhaps, it is that very ability (to communicate) which makes our thinking formal.

Systems as viewpoints
---

As systems are explanation of something. In the previous installment we thought of them as *mental images*. But in the context of communication they are more like *viewpoints*: a mental image at first belongs in the brain of a given person, but if we have different mental images that address the same phenomena, the image becomes a *viewpoint*. 

The *point* in viewpoint is not accidental, as we shall see later.

What is communication 
===

If we view systems as something like *viewpoints* then communication between people would involve transfering those viewpoints from one person to another, or, more formally, transfering those systems from one metasystem to another (you might argue that there are other kinds of communication this is the one that we will be looking at here.) As we all know, this transfer does not happen directly mind-to-mind (and we will see later why it *cannot ever* happen directly), but through a representation which we will call *picture*, as per Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-philosophicus.

Pictures
---

If a logical system can be represented and thought as a *Hasse diagram* (that is a set of points that are connected by arrows) then a picture of a system is any object that represents the structure of such diagram.

A picture need not be a literal Hasse diagram (although, as we shall see later, although Hasse diagrams have certain benefits.) It may be expressed in text, video, conversation or any other media. What defines the picture of a system is just the fact that it contains a system within itself in some way (at least that is intended by its creator.)

Immediately we categorize the pictures in two main categories - formal and non-formal - formal are the pictures where the creator has a hasse diagram of what they want to represent in their mind and non-formal, ones where they do not. Note that a formal picture might be misunderstood (but a non-formal one is *always* misunderstood.

Let's get a real-life example: we are sitting in a bar. I am going to get drinks for you and so I ask you what do you want. You tell me something and I get a drink for you based on your response.

Transfering pictures between agents

Fuziness
---

Your mental process for choosing what to drink is logical (let's say) and the method I get from your description is also logical. But that does not mean that they are the same. This is an essential quality of almost all communication it tends to be fuzzy i.e. what you think is not what I think.
