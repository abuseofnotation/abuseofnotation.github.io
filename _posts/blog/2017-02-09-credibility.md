title: The business of credibility

The credibility of individuals around us influences all choices that we make. But the primary way of gaining credibility is not to “show and prove”, it is someone else who already has it to give it to you. The goal of this article is to show how dumb this concept is, and how we can fix that.

If I have to describe my life up to my early twenties I'd say it is one big waste. School, university, internships. These are steps that we all have to go through before we even start doing real work. They say these institutions prepare us for "real life", but they also take away some of the most productive years from it, while doing so. And if we can’t or don’t want to work the thing we studied for, we have to "start all over again".

It sound weird to some aliens, that someone agrees to spend an enormous amount of money and devote half of his life just to acquire some reputation instead of actually practicing his art and getting better at it? So why do we do it. The answer, for many people, is "degrees", it is to view reputation as a good and to recognize that if they "buy" enough of it, via attending elite universities or working for "good" companies, they might be in a position to sell it and make a ton of money. Someone sold us the idea that if you are credible, you don’t really have to work, and now this idea is a fact of life.

But you can also become credible without actually being good. Those two phenomenums add up to a society in which real skills are often marginalized and professions (especially those in which it is not immediately apparent who is capable and who is not) are ofthen dominated by people who "played their cards right". These same people that later become the role models and educators of the next generation. 

This is only part of the problem, though. Because even if the folks at the university are very wise and the folks who run big-ass companies are indeed the cream of the crop, they are still just people, which means that they sometimes tend to be ignorant and that they are more or less biased towards the way a given problem can be approached. A person gains credibility by by getting the approval of these people. But, like I said, they are just people so they won’t give it to you just because you are as good as them: you will have to become *like* them. 

This is largely why professional stereotypes exist: if someone wants to amount to something in the professions, he/she must first learn to look and act like the people who work in his field. If he/she wants to be a lawyer he/she has to wear a suit. If he/she wants to program, he/she must wear glasses and be a fan of science fiction etc. 

I will give you a meta example: When I started writing this essay at first I spend a lot of time trying to think of a witty and original way to open it. Why? Because writers should be witty. They cannot not just state their ideas and views in a straightforward manner.

Some people might say “We know that what you are saying is partly true, but we just need some kind of standards to decide who to trust.” My answer to them is 1) the current standards you have are lousy and 2) we don’t need standards at all. We can decide based on the task and the person’s qualification for it instead of just assuming that credible people are good at everything and non-credible people are morons. Because we are all morons.

I will go even further by stating that most of us already have an idea of whether a given person will be up for a task or not. The problem (now I realize this) is that we do not trust our own judgement. We go and ask someone who we think is an expert. This is convenient because we do not have to think about the decision, we don’t have to take responsibility for the consequences(“I asked him and he told me to do it. What do you want?”). 

But isn’t convenience just another word for mediocrity?
