In one of the best treatments of the subject of time, "The Critique of Pure Reason" Immanuel Kant introduces that the pure concepts of the understanding, also known as the categories. They are split into four Triads called *quantity*, *quality*, *relation* and *modality*. Notably each class contains three categories, instead of two, as other Kantian taxonomies do where the third category is the combination of the other two. For context, here is the list of categories (descriptions are mine).

Quantity 
- Unity (measure) - recognition of a thing as one 
- Plurality (plurality) - recognition of there being several things 
- **Totality** (whole) - unification of all things (of a given group) as one. 


Quality
- Reality - recognition of presence 
- Negation - recognition of absence
- **Limitation** - recognition of a thing as both present and absent (e.g. in different time periods).

Relation
- Inherence and subsistence - representation of a thing as being inherent, everpresent
- Causality and dependence - representation of causal effects (things being dependent upon other things)
- **Community** - representation of a relation where one thing causes the other and the other way around (causality of a substance as reciprocally determining another substance)

Modality
- Possibility - Impossibility - speculation for the possibility/impossibility of a given thing
- Existence - Non-existence - perception of a thing as existing/non-existing
- **Necessity - Contingency** - acceptance of a thing as inherently true (existence given through possibility itself)

Note that if the third member of each triad is just a combination of the other two then it would really not be "pure"/atomic/first-order and would therefore have to be removed from the list. Kant says that it is not just a combination, but doesn't explain why:

> II. The number of the categories in each class is always the same, namely, three—a fact which also demands some consideration, because in all other cases division à priori through conceptions is necessarily dichotomy. It is to be added, that the third category in each triad always arises from the combination of the second with the first.

> Thus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity; limitation is merely reality conjoined with negation; community is the causality of a substance, reciprocally determining, and determined by other substances; and finally, necessity is nothing but existence, which is given through the possibility itself. Let it not be supposed, however, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not a primitive conception of the pure understanding. For the conjunction of the first and second, in order to produce the third conception, requires a particular function of the understanding, which is by no means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second. Thus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category of totality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude and unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite). Or, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, it does not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how one substance can be the cause of something in another substance, will be understood from that. Thus it is evident that a particular act of the understanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances.

The reason for there being three members, (this is my idea and not Kant's) that *the third member of each triad is not a pure concept of understanding*, but a way to bridge the concepts of understanding to reason. That is, the third member allows us to form a mental image of the *world*, or of *substance * as philosophers call it. And we can have thoughts that are universal.

To understand my point, consider the problem of induction which I talk about in my [text about Gettier](/gettier). You can formulate this problem in the following way: We all know that our knowledge becomes obsolete all the time and that what is valid in one place isn't valid for another. So how can we justify the generalizations that we make about how things are? The simple answer is of this question is that that we cannot. That has been known for millenia, it is so simple that I am inclined to ask another question which is how can we do it? How are we even capable of making such claims. 

The answer lies in the concept of the world, or of substance (I will use the term "the world" as nobody is sure what substance means). The world is a concept that, although it sounds obvious, is a bit weird, if you think about it. Like, why do we even have a concept of something that we cannot ever possibly observe in full? It is the concept of the world that allows us to make general claims, and to act as if we know it all. But let's see the categories.

Now the difference between unity and plurality is obvious, it is, for example, the difference between perceiving a flock of 20 birds as one flock, or as 20 birds. But the difference between those two and totality is massive - they are different types of knowledge - the first two represent knowledge with *limited scope*, while, the third one represents knowledge that is *universally valid*. 

To ellucidate that point, let's go back to the origin of these categories. As some of you might know they come from the Aristotelian syllogisms:

- Plurality - `Some A-s are B` (limited scope)
- Totality - `All A-s are B` (universal scope) 

Seeing things that way makes it obvious that statements that have only limited scope can be justified only by *observation* - if I observe two or three objects that I categorize as `A`s (e.g. "apples") and I find that they possess the property `B` (e.g. "tasty"), I can conclude that `Some A-s are B` based on those observations alone i.e. based on my instincts. 

Statements with universal scope, on the other hand, are axiomatic by their nature - they create reality as much as they describe it. My basis for saying `All A-s are B` is not at all different from my basis for saying `Some A-s are B`. What is different is my decision to assume that this piece of knowledge is universal.

In other words, despite the fact that they contain just two variables (`A` and `B`), statements of the form `All A-s are B`, reference a third object, which we called the world and are making claims about it. e.g. you can rewrite it as `All A-s in this worlds are B`

| Reality | Negation | Limitation |

The third member of the triad of quality is a very misunderstood one. The categories in this triad are based on the concepts of truth and most logics are bivalent, that is, they are based on the idea that propositions have just two possible states - true and false and the categories of reality and negation are based on the values true and false. But then what is limitation based on? 

Well, from one point of view (that I really like) it is based on [intuitionistic logic](category-theory-illustrated/05-logic), where a proposition can indeed have three values - proven, unproven and leading to a contradiction, (where all propositions that lead to contradiction are also unproven). The analogy is even more interesting because intuitionistic logic is related to a mathematical theory called "category theory" [on which I wrote a book about](/category-theory-illustrated) which as the word suggest is inspired by Kant's categories (or maybe by Aristotle's not sure.) 

But at any rate, the point of limitation is clearly visible in the diagram above - using reality and negation, I can only make a statement about a given object, e.g. saying that this object is **B** or saying that it is **not B**. While when using limitation, I am making a statement about the whole world e.g. it divided into B's and non-B (or perhaps un-B).

This is how Kant puts it.

> For example, if I say of the soul, “It is not mortal”—by this negative judgement I should at least ward off error. Now, by the proposition, “The soul is non-mortal,” I have, in respect of the logical form, really affirmed, inasmuch as I thereby place the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal beings. Now, because of the whole sphere of possible existences, the mortal occupies one part, and the immortal the other, neither more nor less is affirmed by the proposition than that the soul is one among the infinite multitude of things which remain over, when I take away the whole mortal part.

There isn't much more to say after this quote. Here the term "the sphere of possible existences" is used in the sense in which I use "the world".

Thus, they (we) have the notion of *permanence*. This notion (I talk about this more in my notes) is a prerequisite for the concept of *change* as we know it, because to say that something is changing you must first view it as permanent, otherwise we would perceive everything as just Heraclitian flux.
