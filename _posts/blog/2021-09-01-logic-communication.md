> We all communicate, or at least we think we do. And I mean communicate in the broadest sense, from spoken communication to written or drawn, from informal to formal (in the sense of logically-formal). We will look into all of that and we will present a whole theory of how communication happens that is based on [the first installment of "How does knowledge work"](/logic-thought) where we basically established a logical framework for modelling how the human mind works.

Oh, you don't care? Well, listen up, it's actually interesting. Plus what better things you have to do, communicate with *actual people*? OK, cool, but listen up, how would you know that you are actually communicating with them, if you are not familiar with the logical foundations of human communication?

Understanding communication is key to understanding our thought process - the only thoughts that we are sure we have, are the ones that we can communicate in some way to other people, or at least to ourselves. But at the same time communication sometimes feel very unreliable and error-prone - in most cases the person whom we are speaking *somewhat* gets what we are saying, they (with the exception of some very trivial cases) never get it quite right. So why is that? 

What is a viewpoint. A summary of the previous article
===

In the [previous installment](/logic-thought) of this series, we claimed that the way we think is inherently logical i.e. it is formal. Then we asked the question: But why and how, then it (our thinking) manages to be so imprecise, e.g. we have thoughts that contradict one another, or opinions that are more complex than simple yes/no. We saw that the best way to answer this question is to postulate that human thought is based on not one but multiple axiomatic systems that work in parralel, and in some cases compete, forming what we called the *system of systems* (or *metasystem* as we will call it here.)

We said that we can view those systems as mental representations or *explanations* that we are considering when making a decision each of which carries some weight in the final result, using what we called *levels of relevance* to a given problem. 

Finally, we mentioned two ways in which these levels of relevance are determined: 

1. By elementary positive response from the body (e.g. instincts)
2. From family resemblance with systems that are already established as "true".

In this installment, we will see that not only the way we think, but the way we communicate is formal as well, and that perhaps it is that very ability (to communicate) which makes our thinking formal. 

We will also examine in detail those two mechanisms for determining the relevance of a given theory in the light of what we discovered.

Systems as viewpoints
---

Systems are *theories* or *explanations* of some phenomena. In the context of the brain, which we examined in the previous installment, we thought of them as *mental images* (means of explaining somethig to *ourselves*). In the context of communication they are more appropriately likened to *viewpoints* (means of explaining something to *other people*). If you examine the two concepts closely, you will see that *the difference between them is only superficial* - when a theory belongs just in the mind of its creator, it is is a mental image, but if it is shared by them with different people, it becomes a *viewpoint* that this person has, about a given state of affairs (although one person can have multiple viewpoints.)

Viewpoint pictures 
===

If we view systems as something like *viewpoints* then communication between people would involve transfering those viewpoints from one person to another, or, more formally, transfering those systems from one metasystem to another (you might argue that there are other kinds of communication this is the one that we will be looking at here.) But, as we all know, this transfer does not happen directly mind-to-mind (and we will see later why it *cannot ever* happen directly), but through crafting representations of those viewpoints, which we will call *picture*, as per Wittgenstein, who originally came up with most of this stuff.

A logical system/viewpoint can be represented and thought of as a *Hasse diagram* (that is a set of points that are connected by arrows.) A *picture* of a viewpoint, then, is any object that represents the structure of such diagram.

A picture need not be a literal Hasse diagram (although using literal Hasse diagrams has certain benefits) - it may be expressed in text, video, conversation or any other media. What defines the picture of a viewpoint is just the fact that it contains the viewpoint within itself in some way (at least that is intended by its creator.)

Immediately we can split pictures in two main categories - *formal* and *non-formal* (fuzzy) pictures. A working definition: formal are the pictures created by a person who has a Hasse diagram of what they want to represent in their mind, and non-formal are the ones where they do not. Note that a formal picture *might* be misunderstood, i.e. the picture that is in the communicator's mind end up different from the one which is received, however, a non-formal one is (in some sense) *always* misunderstood, simply because it doesn't have a single logically sound interpretation.

Formal viewpoints
---

To understand the distinction better, consider this real-life example: we are sitting in a bar. I am going to get drinks for you and so I ask you what do you want and you reply the following:

> Get me a beer, low alcoholic one, if there isn't such, or if it's very expensive, I just want a glass of water.

You notice that your response describes your wishes in a way that would allow the listener to replicate your thinking process in a way that would guarantee that they would always reach the exact same conclusion that you intended them to reach, provided that they understand the words in the same way as you do. This is what we mean when we say that it is *formal*. 

And it is my thesis that it having these qualities implies that my response can be represented by a Hasse diagram, and vice versa.

The diagram is decidable (a choice can be made at all circumstance) , if we presume that the law of excluded middle - <b>b or ¬b</b> - holds (and that the bar serves water.)
  </figcaption>
</figure>


Non-formal pictures
---

A non-formal response, in contrast, is one that cannot be adequally represented by a Hasse diagram: 

It can be one that is *fuzzy* and allows room for interpretation, i.e. it doesn't describe a Hasse diagram precisely e.g. if you ask a person what they want for drinks an they say something like "I don't know, perhaps some white wine, or a cocktail. I fancy something fresh with some strong flavour..." Such response maybe contains some info, but it puts thrust to the receiver to fill the blanks.

Another type of non-formal response would be one which results in a *invalid* Hasse diagram e.g. one that contains circular logic (not sure if there are other examples.)

  <figcaption>

</figure>


Another type of diagrams that are somewhere in between those two categories are ones that are technically formal but useless: ones that require so many conditions as given and/or contain so little logic that they provide little to no value in making a decision.

Viewpoint Contexts
===

Does the existence of formal pictures mean that our communication can be completely formal? No, because although the viewpoint the person expresses can be specified formally, the *context* in which this viewpoint lives can never be. To see why, we examine our example formal picture and, in particular, it's constituents (the points in the Hasse diagram) 

> Get me a beer, *low-alcoholic one*, if there isn't such, or if it's *very expensive*, I just want a glass of water.

As we can see, these terms are not precisely defined i.e. they are opened to interpretation, e.g. if the person who we are sending to get us drinks is significantly wealthier than us, or a heavier drinker, their idea of "cheap" and "low-alcoholic", respectively, would not match ours. This is not an error in communicating the viewpoint itself, but an error which result from the presumptions about where this viewpoint is to be positioned, where it fits in the whole system of systems that is the brain.

As you can guess, what we call the context of a viewpoint is actually just a collection of other viewpoints that it depends on i.e. it's viewpoints all the way down.

To formalize this context, and thus remove any chance of misunderstanding which might potentially result in me getting the wrong kind of drink, we would have to provide a description of the viewpoints that form this context e.g. provide a description of what I think is a reasonably-priced beer. This would certainly minimize the chance of error, but it *will not eradicate it*, because my viewpoint for a reasonably-priced beer would depend on some other, more basic viewpoints (e.g. the viewpoint of what is beer in the first place) which, in turn would depend on even more basic viewpoints and so on.

For this reason, even if your mental process for choosing what to drink is logical (let's say) and the method I get from your description is also logical, that does not mean that they are the same. This is an essential quality of almost all communication it tends to be fuzzy i.e. what you think is not what I think.

For a detailed description of how I believe the system of viewpoints function, refer to this quote from the first part of the article (there they are called "logical systems" instead of "viewpoints", as the context is different.)

> Based on their relationship to observation, logical systems can be viewed as a tree with the most concrete and observation-driven ones located at the tree's root, and the most abstract ones, at its branches. I think that this relationship is key to the way the brain uses these systems: presented with sensory data, it (the brain) probably invokes a most primitive system first - one which does not make any important assertions, but merely converts that sensory data into a model which is a little bit more structured. Having that model, the brain can map it with a number of more abstract systems, each of them producing an ever more structured model as a result. These models will, in turn, be fed to a couple more abstract systems and so on. 

<figure>
  <img src="/images/logic/chain.svg" width="100%">
  <figcaption>
    A set of observations which are a result of sensory data (at the bottom of the diagram) are mapped to a simple logical system (at the centre), which in turn is mapped to a more complex one (top).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

> With each "jump" from one less abstract system to another more abstract one, more and more is "known" about a given situation, but at the same time, there are more and more possible interpretations, each giving us a separate system of analysing the situation. 


What is communication
===

Now that we have a basic understanding of the way information is transferred, let's outline the communication process itself (of which we already have some idea.) 

The process of communication comes in two parts: transferring of *pictures* and transfer of their *contexts*.


Transfering pictures between agents
---

The prerequisite for the occurence of communication is the existence of at least two *agents*.

  </figcaption>
</figure>



Transfering context between agents
---

And so the only way for us to be completely precise in our language is to start with the most basic terms there is and to communicate the whole tree of viewpoints that are relevant, as context to the one we are communicationg i.e. to more or less transfer to the other person the *complete contents of our brain*. This is theoretically possible, but it is not what we are doing.


Thoughts and communication
===

We tend to think of logical pictures as existing in an individual first and being transferred second, but it makes a lot of sense for things to be reversed - that is that communication enables us to be logical.
