title: The Many Worlds Hypothesis and our Survivorship Bias
layout: blog

If we believe the many-worlds hypothesis in quantum mechanics, then some portion of what we know as the law of causality might be a result of the survivorship bias of our current self which does not observe its alternative counterparts in all other worlds.

According to Wikipedia, survivorship bias is "the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of lack of visibility". The textbook example is the mistake made by a person who predicts that the world would never be destroyed in a nuclear war because he/she has seen many such threads in the past but that hasn't happened *so far*. What this person does not take into account is that if a nuclear war *did* take place in the past, then he/she will be much less likely to exist and therefore much less likely to *make that prediction in the first place*. In other words, out of all the realities where a nuclear war was about to take place, we can only exist in the one where it didn't actually happen and that is why we don't see the others.

Sometimes the results from the selection process aren't being erased - they are just not visible for *you*. Say, for example, you read that a toast always lands with the butter-side down, and decide to test it. You take a "fair toast" and you start dropping it on purpose. But to your surprise, the toast always lands with the butter side up - exactly the opposite of what you expected. You check it like twenty times before you convince yourself that you are right. But before you announce your discovery to the world and think of it as universally-valid, you have to determine, the following - how many people are testing the butter-side down hypothesis? Indeed, this number does not have anything to do with the result of *your* toast turning experiment, but it has everything to do with the chance that *anyone* gets that same result and announces it. The more people are experimenting with toasts right now, the bigger the chance of one of them getting an unusual result (and therefore the less significant this result is). In this case, the fallacy is easy to test by just gathering many different instances of the experiment and comparing results (i.e. the scientific method).

If we concentrate on the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, we see that it leads to an instance of survivorship bias that is as pervasive as the one from my second example and as hard to detect as the one from the first one - we, the inhabitance of universe X (as I would call the world with which we are entangled with), make all of our assumptions about the true nature of reality without regarding the fact that we are observing only one of the, possibly infinitely-many, worlds that exist. Every time quantum entanglement occurs, a selection process is carried out, in which the observer (i.e. you) is placed in a state that is chosen at random. All other states are isolated from him, hence the lack of visibility is also total. The conclusion, for me, is that basically everything that we deduce about reality, in terms of cause and effect are not truly fundamental they are just a description of universe X.

Even if you don't consider these alternative realities "real", the fact remains that our reality is governed by randomness and this problem is still there. Incidentally, you can formulate a version this problem which does not involve quantum mechanics at all as David Hume did - even if the universe is deterministic and is in fact governed by a set of laws, the fact is that *no one here has these laws*. I like to use this article to give props to David Hume for being both an atheist before the theory of evolution and for disputing the validity of the causality principle before quantum mechanics.
