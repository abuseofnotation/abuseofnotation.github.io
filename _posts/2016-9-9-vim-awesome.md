Praise the best text editor

<!--more-->

The title of this post sounds like a school essay and this is because [I like it like that](credibility). This is, after all yet another post from yet another vim evangelist. But everything I say is true.

What is vim
===

If you are not familiar with vim, you have to know it is all of these things:

1. A command-line text editor.

2. A rudimentary scripting language for automated text editing.

3. A system of keyboard shortcuts (key-bindings) for text editing, which is implemented in one form or another in every development environment.

It is also:

1. One of the oldest active software projects.

2. A key piece of UNIX.

3. A tool that you can get running within half a second on almost every computer or server (except the ones with Windows).

Why it is awesome (objective part).

Vim is the most efficient way to edit any form of text, be it computer code, which is its primary purpose, or just a regular article like this one.

Why it is awesome (subjective part).

In times when software tools come and go faster than we can get used to them, vim is here for us to admire and learn from. It is ellegant and polished in a way that few software tools are.
