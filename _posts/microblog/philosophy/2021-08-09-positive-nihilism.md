Positive nihilism:

Nothing that you say or do matters in the grand scheme of things, and this is pathetic, but more pathetic is the refusal to accept that fact, instead of conforming to it and thus making it the only thing you conform to: 

Your achievements don't matter, so no point in being dishonest.

You failures don't matter, so no point in giving up.

Your strive to perfection is vain, so no point in pressuring yourself.
