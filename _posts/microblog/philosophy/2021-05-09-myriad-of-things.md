Dogen's concept of a "myriad of things" (or "the thousand things" as it is sometimes translated) is very similar to Kant's concept of the "manifold of sensibility", essentially both are trying to highlight the novel, flux-like aspect of reality, the fact that the concept of objects are subjective (no pun intended). It would be a really cool plot twist if it turned out that Kant had read Dogen (very highly unlikely in real life).
