Re-reading "I am a strange loop" and finding much stuff that I missed originally. I like the author's idea of an organism's concept of self as the central concept in an organism's system of thought, and the one that binds all other concepts together. 

Like, a concept is considered true and real by us only if it relates to our concept of ourselves. Our concept of ourselves is the realest thing there exists for us (although it in actuality is completely objective).
