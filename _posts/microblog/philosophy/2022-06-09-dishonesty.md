This morning I woke up with the following question in mind: What are the characteristics of the mental process that strips life from it's dreamlike properties and makes it dull and monotonous? 

My theory is has to do with dishonesty.

Dishonesty are the processes  in which we purposefully create an interpretation of the facts that we know is not the most truthful interpretation. 

So, when being dishonest, we have to maintain two separate interpretations - the true one (which would always exist), and the the one we want to believe and/or want others to believe.

the true interpretation is "alive" - it always updates, it always has something happening with it.

The false one, is less connected to reality, so it is static. Nothing happens in it, as we have to ignore the reality with which it is incompatible.
