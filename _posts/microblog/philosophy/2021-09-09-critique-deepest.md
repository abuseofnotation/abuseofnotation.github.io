At first I thought that the Transcendental Deduction was the heart of the matter of "The Critique of Pure Reason", but upon rereading, it's definitely not it. The deepest chapter is appropriately called "Systematic representation of All the Synthetic Principles of Pure Understanding" and is awesome. Especially the "Analogies of Experience" and the "Anticipation of Perception" are so deep that I did not understand a single word at first, but it all comes together with time.
