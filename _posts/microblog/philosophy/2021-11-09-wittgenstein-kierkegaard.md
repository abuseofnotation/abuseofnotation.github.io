Look how different philosophers are from one another: 

Wittgenstein's last words (upon hearing that friends are coming to visit him): "Tell them I've had a wonderful life‚Äù

Kierkegaard's were "My life is a great, to others unknown and incomprehensible suffering."

Seems that Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard are the modern version of the laughing and the crying philosopher.
