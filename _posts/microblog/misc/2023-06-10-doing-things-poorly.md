One of the best pieces of advice that I got (and give) is this:

"Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly"

And conversely, everything that is not worth doing poorly is not worth doing at all.

Corrollary: Aim to create the crappiest imaginable version of a great work, rather than a flawless but mediocre work.
