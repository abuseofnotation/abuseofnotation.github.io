Society in which you step over homeless folks on your way to pointlessly click and type on the computer all day, is deeply fucked up. And you have to be veeery brainwashed to not realize that. 

Society where everyone's main activity is to do a "job" that serves no purpose but to make some people richer.

Where we commute to that "job" by cars while the planet is dying.

Where we are only allowed to do this "job" in an "office", although it was clearly proven that they are just as capable of doing it at home.

Where there are still people are sleeping on the streets, people who can be sheltered in the "offices", but instead we are supposed to just run over those people our way to work and not care.

And we are supposed to pretend all of this is OK, lest we are fired from this system and have to lie down next to those people.

Well, it's not worth it.
