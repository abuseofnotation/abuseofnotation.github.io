There is an ability I call *unity of thought*, for a lack of a better word, which is essential for acquiring intelligence/wisdom. It is the ability to connect each new idea/view that you have, with all the other ideas/views in your mind, to make it compatible with those. And to drop the ideas and views that aren't compatible.

(it is called *holding* a view for a reason --- it takes effort and you cannot do it with too many of those.)

Unifying your thoughts sets your mind free, but it requires commitment.

It requires that you remain consistent in your thoughts and view, even in contexts where this is not beneficial to you. 

It requires you to reject the ideas that your brain wants you to reject.

No compromise.

Trying to balance a different set of views and ideas, depending on the situation, will make you dumb and will mess up your mental health...
