What is conformism. Dictionary defines it as "*willingness* to conform", but I think a better definition of conformism would be the *want*, *desire* to conform (as everyone are willing to conform when given the right motivation). This is not a complete definition either, because in order to have conformism you have to have something to confront to i.e. an established way of doing things which in turns entails that there must be an an establish*ment* i.e. a group of people who determine what's right and wrong.

The two things are very interrelated - you cannot have conformists without having establishment and you cannot have establishment without having conformists. 

I think that it is unquestionable that the dream of every aspiring conformist would be for the, to become the establishment, to be the person who sets the agenda. Only then would a conformist be who they want to be i.e. conformists are people are ready to change the whole world, just so they can be who they want to be *while remaining conformists*. 

No need for that. Just donâ€™t be conformists. Conformity is not the way.
