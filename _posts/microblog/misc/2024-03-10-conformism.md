What is conformism. Dictionary defines it as "*willingness* to conform", but I think a better definition of conformism would be the *want*, *desire* to conform (as everyone are willing to conform when given the right motivation). This is not a complete definition either, because in order to have conformism you have to have something to confront to i.e. an established way of doing things which in turns entails that there must be an an establish*ment* i.e. a group of people who determine what's right and wrong.

The two things are very interrelated - you cannot have conformists without having establishment and you cannot have establishment without having conformists. 

I think that it is unquestionable that the dream of every aspiring conformist would be for the, to become the establishment, to be the person who sets the agenda. Only then would a conformist be who they want to be i.e. conformists are people are ready to change the whole world, just so they can be who they want to be *while remaining conformists*. To these people, I want to say: "No need for that. Just don’t be conformists. Conformity is not the way."

Conformism is also related to tolerance, or, more precisely to the *lack* of tolerance. Tolerance is not the elevated state of mind that some people present it to be, but rather a discovery --- the discovery that you can be/do what you want to be/do, and others can... do whatever they want, actually, without there being any conflict.

Once you make that discovery, a lot of things follow (e.g. that you should not be conformists, that the way our lives are organized is fucking stupid).
