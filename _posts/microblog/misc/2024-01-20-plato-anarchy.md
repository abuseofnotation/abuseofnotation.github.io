The more I reread The Republic, the more I think that the guy who argued with Socrates at the beginning had a solid point --- justice is whatever the rulers say. Incidentally, this argument leads straight to anarchy  (the system which is taken to be bad, without any arguments). 

> Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are aristocracies?
> 
> Yes, I know.
>
> And the government is the ruling power in each state?
>
> Certainly.

> And the different forms of government make laws democratical, aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and these laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what I mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of justice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of the stronger.
