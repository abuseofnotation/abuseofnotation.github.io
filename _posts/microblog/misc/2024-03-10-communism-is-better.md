Too much of the left wing/right wing discussion is about which is better, when every ideology is bad when pushed to the extreme: If you lean to the far right you get wars, genocide, people dying on the street etc. and in the far left you get degrowth, free health care and education for everyone and stripping the rich out of their capital. Obviously both of these things are equally catastrophic.
