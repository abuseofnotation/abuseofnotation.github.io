- Hey, Captain is it just me, or is the airplane headed straight to this huge volcanic crater, full of hot lava?
- Yup, we will likely be all dead in a minute!
- OK, so will you try to maybe, you know, alter our course?
- I won’t, because that didn’t work out when the Russians tried doing it the 1940s.

The course leading to drowning in lava might not be a *good* course, but it is the best one out there!
