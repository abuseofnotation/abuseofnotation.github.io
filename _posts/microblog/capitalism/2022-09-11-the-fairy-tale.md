**The fairy tale:** capitalism works because motivated by money and by money only and capitalism  provides them with opportunities to make more of it.

**The truth:** capitalism "works" by enabling people in power to exploit the rest of them, but this is justified because they generate massive amounts of wealth, which is all that matters if you believe the fairy tale.

To break free from capitalism, you have to break free from the fairy tale. Is money really so important? Would you spend your days in toxic environment for money? Would you ignore your friends and family for money? Would you sacrifice your health for money? Or the health of the planet?

The fact is that many people do these things and this fact has been used as proof that money is indeed the most important thing for most people. 

But that's nonsense. People don't do bad things for money because they are evil, or extremely materialistic by nature, they do them because they are *hostages* to the system, because the belief in the fairy tale made a society where money is equal to life itself.

Those are both poor and rich people that I am talking about. Both people who have no other options and people who do have them but don't realize it. But they all have something in common - if they stop believing the fairy tale, they would be outcasts, they would have a hard time adapting to society, they (we) will not be sure what to do with their lives.

Statistics that indicate the well-being of people in a nation:
- Life expectancy
- Access to health care
- Literacy
- Percentage of people that own their own homes

Statistics that are most often displayed in the media:
- GDP
- GDP per capita
- Economic growth

The fairy tale says that boosting the ones from below would inevitably result in boosting the ones from above. But is this really the case?
