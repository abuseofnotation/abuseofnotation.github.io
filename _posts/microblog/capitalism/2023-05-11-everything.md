"I have everything but I am still not happy."

Well, that's because you *don't* have everything, you have just money (and things that you can buy with it)

You don't have a job that satisfies you while letting you retain your piece of mind.

You don't have quality relationships with people who will be there for you, even if you are broke.

You don't have material objects that fulfill your needs without having maintenance costs that make you dependent on corporations that you don't want to depend on.

Or maybe you understand that you need all these things, but you are thought that you need them *in addition* to being rich. 

Or that you want to make money *first* and then concentrate on everything else.

Both of these are dead ends. Act now to attain what you want. *Directly*.

Why, cause "character is faith," as Heraclitus says. The saying is more literal than it seems:

Pursuing your goals is not merely a *prerequisite* to getting the results you want. If you look at it from the grand scale, *goals are themselves results* - pursuing the goal to be good ("good" both as a person or good at some specific skill) is the same thing as *being good*. 

By the same token, pursuing a goal as obtuse and meaningless as money makes you an obtuse and meaningless person.

e.g. a person who is sorry for whatever bad thing  they have done and wants to be a good person *already is* a good person, better than a billionaire who donates 10% of this fortune to charity.

10-year-old-kid who has set their mind to become a great pianist *is* a great pianist, better than anyone who merely plays just for the money.
