I was thinking that Plato allegedly said that ignorance is the only sin and if it's possible that he said that, since the concept of a sin came later in history and I suddenly realized that the concept of a sin is pure BS Like "There is this thing that you would really like to do but you should not do it because it is wrong (and God will punish you), so you should never ever do it and you should beat yourself (literary) when you go as far as to think about it."

That's like saying "you're guilty until proven innocent, and you will never be innocent. All you can do is pray to *us* to relieve your pain." 

The doctrine of the world's major religion is just totalitarian propaganda, thinly disguised as advice/prophecy.

Like, if you take the fable about Adam and Eve and the apple. What does the apple represent? Sex? Knowledge? Or most probably just *opposition to authority*. Not clear what was God's purpose with putting the tree there. All we understand is that if we do wrong we will be punished and we already did wrong...
