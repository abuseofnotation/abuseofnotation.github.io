I talked about the service market being a scam. So why are services so popular. IMO it is not because people don't have time to do things themselves, but because they lack mental capacity to do it e.g. people don't order food because they don't have time to prepare it themselves (we have better technology for preparing food than ever), they just don't want to think about one more thing. Same for online services like Netflix and Spotify --- it's not that we don't have time to download our music and movies any more (if you are using Netflix you have at least one spare hour each day), we just don't want to be bothered, which is sad, as it is making us more and more dependent on these services.

People are increasingly incapable of doing anything other than their "job" and the jobs themselves are increasingly dumber, due to the fact that they would have to service clients who are getting increasingly dumber --- "My job is to deal with idiots" rings truer and truer.

And this situation hurts our social life as well, I am old enough to remember when friends got together to do stuff together --- we used to cook together, fix stuff together, hack stuff together, assemble furniture, or just carry some heavy crates from A to B. Before that we did farming and a gazzilion other fun activities Now it seems that we "outsourced" these in order to just do nothing.
