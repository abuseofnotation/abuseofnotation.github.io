"My life is like a prison"

I wrote this in my personal website when I was 14.

I was quite correct in pinpointing the problem, pinpointing how I, and many other people, felt, but I was off at identifying the cause --- I thought, that I was kept in this prison by systems of power, like school, parents, later bosses and landlords. So I fought those.

But, after advancing with this fight, I realized that it is not the systems of power per se that limit me (although they are certainly designed to do that, and certainly help) but rather my engagement with those systems --- fighting your parents, bosses etc. would just make you more like them. So, advance to the next stage, cancel them, stop engaging. Don't break free, just walk away. 

The systems of power are only holding your material self, divorce from it and you are free. Moreover, this is the only way to be free, otherwise you are just moving into a bigger cell.

As for the people, don't hate them, don't pity them, rather be compassionate and empathetic towards them, if possible, educate them over what they are doing!
