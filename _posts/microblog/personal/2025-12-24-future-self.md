Everything we do to secure ourselves, every decision we make out of fear of the future, ends up destroying us, ends up making our future a little more bleak --- the closer we are to the public ideal of "success", the farther we go from our own private, ideal, from our soul, if you want...

Because ultimately it is not the future, but our *past* that defines us. The past determines who we are and it is the past that we should think about when making decisions, not the future. "What would my position be tomorrow?" is unimportant. But "How would I feel about *myself* tomorrow?" is the real question. 

And you won't feel good, if you are betraying your past self, for the welfare of a future self, which will never materialize, which remains only a vain hope, that gets more and more disconnected from reality.
