The road I walk is new.
It's made not of stone, but dirt.
There are no road signs yet.
And no bridges to cover the rivers.

The road I walk is new, 
so people think that it is hard.
"How do swim?" "Don't you get dirty?"
"How do you cope with all that uncertainty?"

But actually, I am not concerned with all that.
I am not in a rush, 
I am not lazy
I am prepared to go wherever my road takes me.

There is only one kind of obstacle that puts me off:
having to go through other people's highways.

***

The road I want to go through is new.
Made, like mine, not of stone, but dirt.
Maybe some road signs, but just a few.
Enough to lead me, 
to the person who builds it.
