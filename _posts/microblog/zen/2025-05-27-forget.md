I want to forget Gaza.
I want to forget the pain.
I want to forget all dumb jokes, old song lyrics.
I want to forget that most things ever happened, 
as remembering makes everything tedious.
Forces you to become a bureaucrat of your memories, to look everything up.
As if you don't *know*.

I want to forget it all
So the person of the next moment 
can finally start a new.
