I don't want to lose the human in me,

I don't want to have to see the world through their ways.

I don't want to have to feel through their point of view, 

To be locked inside it like an alien in a space suit.

I don't have to lose the human in me.

Simply because noone has to do anything.

I'd never choose death before life, 

But if death it is, let it at least be a real one.
