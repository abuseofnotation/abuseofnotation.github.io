Using logic to model real-world thinking
===


> "Hello, and welcome to another episode of "Logic for Y'all". Today we are going to tackle a rather controversial topic - "Using logic to model real-world thinking". Asked to comment on it, most people went: "Pff, logic!" and our resident logicians prepared the following summary: "Pff, the real world!". But still among our listeners there were some wannabe philosophers who insisted that this is the most important thing ever so it appears that we have no choice but to get someone to talk about it (there will be booze at the end). So can we please give a warm welcome to the only guy who agreed to speak about this rubbish topic, Boris Marinoooov!"

Logic is a pretty misunderstood topic. Some 2000 years old as a discipline, it has been used in many disciplines as mathematics, computer programming etc. but it has less and less to do with its original purpose - modelling the way we think to achieve correctness. And trying to use logic to analyse an everyday conversation will reveal at once why this is the case - most of the think we say are neither logically sound, nor we expect or want them to be. What is a *logical* conversation anyways? Given a set of assumptions and a set rules for manipulating these assumptions, you can use logic to generate some other assumptions. So a logical conversation would be something like:

> "Hm, it rained today. And had to go outside, so I got wet."
> "People get wet when it rains and they don't carry an umbrella. I guess you forgot your umbrella."

Nevertheless, it is clear that Aristotle was onto something when he invented the subject. So why isn't our thinking and conversations "logical" in the sense in which the above example is? The most obvious answer is that we do not strive for correctness in our thoughts and speech, so logic is just not useful for us, but for me this answer is wrong. What else can thinking be, but a strive for correctness? If we manage to think a thought, then it has to be correct in a certain sense and under certain rules. The question is what these rules are. 

In search of true/false
---

The first thing that I plan to do is to attempt to extend logic and define a system I can use it to model real-world thinking, that is perceiving the world around us and acting on these perceptions. 

The first step is to define what truth is. But in order to start the journey at all, we must first what flavour of logic we should use - classical or constructive. 

In classical logic, True/False is an inherent characteristic of of each and every thing that we say. This is not at all how our perceptions and thoughts work - we constantly say and think things that are neither true nor false, or are somewhere in between. In constructive logic (or "Intuitionistic logic"as it is also called), things are a bit more "realistic" - True and False are just assertions like anything else and there can be statements which are neither True or False. For this reason I would pick constructive logic as a basis of my logical framework for modelling human perception.

If we are going to use constructive type of logic for modelling the world (and even if we aren't), we have to pick the core set of assertions that imply Truth. These assertions (or assertion) will act as the "seed" of our logical framework and everything else will follow from them. Let's start with the following statement: "everything that I see with my own eyes is true". From this it would follow that, for example, it is true that I am a human being, it is true that I am sitting in front of a computer etc. (I can see that I am standing in front a computer *and* everything I see is true, *therefore* I am sitting in front of a computer) etc. 

There are many statements that we cannot verify with our own eyes but we consider "true" in some sense, like mathematical statements, for example - simpler math statements like 1 + 1 = 2 may reside in the visible spectre, but there is no way to "see" that the square root of 2 is irrational, for example. Depending on your background, you may consider mathematics anything between the language of nature and a load of bullcrap. But one thing is for certain - mathematical statements are not true *in the same way* as statements about everyday objects that we see. Based on this statement, we can conclude that *in real-life thinking there are not one, but several concepts of truth and ways in which a given statement is true of false*. As we shall see later, actually the whole unique characteristic of thinking arises from the way in which those concepts connect. 

A system of systems
---

Our power to observe stuff is base source of truth, but there are an infinite number of other sources, such as truths based on scienses, not to mention ones based on belief (and by belief I don't mean just religious belief, which some people don't endourse, but belief in authorities, on which all people rely). Not all of these sources have to be so official as "Mathematically True" or "True as Observed" (or even as "It's in the Bible") - there are also stuff as trivial as "My Father Told me so" and a million other nameless ones. Each of these sources brings with itself its own notion of objects (such as "one", "God", and apple) a sets of logical operations for these objects ("plus", "sin", "eat"). In other words it brings a completely separate *logical system* which the brain can utilize in a given context. Because, not only does mathematics have its own concept of truth, it also has a unique method of reasoning, that is, of deciding whether a given proposition is true bases on other propositions.

My main claim with this article is that the brain rarely uses just one system to judge how to react in a given situation - it uses a multitude of systems (or even it can use one system in multitude of ways): in a single decision mathematics, religion, can all play a role, as well as one's sense of duty. This mash captures the concept of "everyday thinking" which I am trying to express. The one where nothing is true in general but everything is true in some context (and in which perceiving a statement often involves finding out the context in which it is true). 

Connections and hierarchies
---

When we started, we said that there is one main source of truth, which is the truth based on observation. This is actually an oversimplification: there cannot be a logical system which is based *entirely* on observation - it has to contain some *interpretation* of that observation in order to be logical e.g. a way to know where one object ends and when another begins. In the same way way as any abstract system has to contain some observational element in it, so it is somehow rellevant to the real world. This leads us to a paradox:  If the only way for us to know something about the world is through observation, then how can our brain apply any "higher-level" system such as ones given by mathematics and the sciences etc, in real-world situations? After all, our ears and eyes do not perceive numbers directly, they perceive photons, sound waves etc. 

I think that the basic approach is for it to start applying more primitive systems first, in order to  convert the blob of sensory data into a model, containing objects, spacial relationships etc. Once it has that model, it can apply a more abstract systems to it. The output of the abstract system can go to a yet more abstract system ad innfinitum.

Based on their relation to observation, logical systems form a tree. The ones which are more observation-based are at the root and all more abstract systems form the tree's branches. This hierarchy represents not only the way these systems developed from one another, but the way in which they invoke one another.

The systems which are closer to observable reality are primitive. What is "true" in their terms is equal to what is visible in these images. In this sense, we can hardly even call them "logical", because they infer very little relationships between objects - mostly they provide just a plain list of objects and facts.

Most of what we call "thinking" is actually done in more complex systems - ones which work in more abstract terms, they are not directly related to any observable reality. They stylize the picture of the world. They have much narrow focus, but are much more powerful as to what they can deduce.

Empiricism, induction and feedback loops

The logic of communication

But sometimes the connection is more abstract, for example using systems which we use to communicate with other people, we can have the "dopamine kick", or the feeling of safety which suffocates our fear. There are classes of system, in which the positive response comes not due to positive outcome for the individual in the external world, but as a direct consequence of using the system itself. 


But one thing is for sure - these two systems (the new one which you just created and the old one, on which it is based) are now reinforcing each other. Their concept of truth being related, they form a comfortable island in your consciousness where things agree with each other. This is the closest thing to a "univeral truth" that exists - a group of several systems which have a similar structure and all of them "work" in different contexts.

Intelligence lies as much in creating and using systems, as much as it lies in knowing what they are and why they function.
