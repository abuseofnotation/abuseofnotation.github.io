Truth. Using logic to model the world of human perception
===


> "Hello, and welcome to another episode of "Logic for Y'all". Today we are going to tackle a rather controversial topic - using logic to model the world as it is perceived by us humans. Asked to comment on it, most people went: "Pff, logic!" and our resident logicians prepared the following summary: "Pff, the real world!". But still among our listeners there were some wannabe philosophers who insisted that this is the most important thing ever so it appears that we have no choice but to talk about it for some time (there will be booze at the end). So can we please give a warm welcome to the only guy who agreed to speak about this rubbish topic, Boris Marinoooov!"

Logic is a pretty misunderstood topic. It was originaly conceived as a way to model our thoughts so they are always correct (I think). Then some people tried to use it as a basis for describing mathematics. When (two thousand years after its inception) it was discovered that logic can be used for making computers, it was finaly useful. But due to that, we find logic shifting away from its original purpose. 

Trying to use logic to analyse an everyday conversation will reveal at once why this is the case - most of the think we say are neither logically sound, nor we expect or want them to be. What is a *logical* conversation anyways? Given a set of assumptions and a set rules for manipulating these assumptions, you can use logic to generate some other assumptions. So a logical conversation would be something like:

> "Hm, it rained today. And had to go outside, so I got wet."
> "People get wet when it rains and they don't carry an umbrella. I guess you forgot your umbrella."

In other words, logic covers a very small amount of the things that a human being will ever say, if any. In this text, I will attempt to find out why it is the case and try to extend logic so it can succeed in covering some more cases. 

In search of True and False
===

In classical logic, True/False is an inherent characteristic of of each and every thing that we say. This is not at all how our perceptions and thoughts work - we constantly say (and think) things that are neither true nor false (or are somewhere in between). In constructive logic (or "Intuitionistic logic"as it is also called) things are a bit more "realistic" - True and False are just assertions like anything else and there can be statements which are neither True or False. For this reason I would pick constructive logic as a basis of our logical framework.

If we are going to use constructive type of logic for modelling the world (and even if we aren't), we have to pick the core assertion or assertions that imply Truth, else we wouldn't really be able to say anything. These assertions (or assertion) will act as the "seed" of our logical framework and everything else will follow from it. Let's take, for example, the following statement (which I'd argue is pretty much the initial seed of our thinking too): "everything that I see with my own eyes is true". From this it would follow that, for example, it is true that I am a human being, it is true that I am sitting in front of a computer etc. (I can see that I am standing in front a computer *and* everything I see is true, *therefore* I am sitting in front of a computer) etc. 

There are many statements that we cannot verify with our own eyes but we consider "true", like mathematical statements, for example (simpler math statements like 1 + 1 = 2 may reside in the visible spectre, but there is no way to "see" that the square root of 2 is irrationa, for example). Depending on your background, you may consider mathematics anything between, the language of nature which is the closest thing we have to real truth, or just a load of bullcrap which is created by people who want to look smart, but one thing is for certain - mathematical statements are not true *in the same way* as statements about everyday objects that we see - "1 + 1 = 2." is not true in the same way as "My shirt is blue." and I think that the reason for this is that real-life thinking relies on not just one or several sources of truth, (and, as we shall see later, actuallly the whole unique characteristic of thinking arises from the way in which those systems connect). 

Our power to observe stuff is maybe the biggest source of truth, and the basis of our understanding, but it is definitely not absolute. Furthermore, there are an infinite number of other sources, such as truth based on scienses, not to mention ones based on belief (and by belief I don't mean just religious belief (of which just a portion of people are relying to), but belief in authorities on which all people rely). Not all of these sources have to be so official as "Mathematically True" or "True as Observed" (or even as "It's in the Bible") - there are also stuff as trivial as "My Father Told me so", "Stuff that If True would mean I am Cool" and so on. Each of these sources brings with itself a set of objects (such as "one", "God", and apple) and a sets of logical operations for these objects ("plus", "sin", "eat").


A system of systems
===

To complete our system, we should somehow connect all those contexts with one another. Probably the easiest way to do so is by featuring an object "X" called something like "Universal truth" from which all other truths would follow. This would effectively make all other truth objects subordinate to X (as they have to follow from it in order to be truth objects at all) and would make out picture much more simple and neat. For example to make a connection between two contexts, all we have to do is see how they both relate to X. But I'd argue that *this is not how our brain works*. People who have chosen their X's, would say that I am wrong, or that I think so just because I haven't discovered X, but I rest my case - no matter how important X is for you, you are still sometimes thinking about things which have nothing to do with X, so saying that everything true follows from X, whatever X is would be incomplete at best. 

I claim that the brain rarely uses just one system to judge how to react in a given situation - it uses a multitude of systems (or even it can use one system in multitude of ways): a single decision can involve mathematics, religion, nurturing of one's sense of importance etc. And while this is not true for *every* decision, it is, I think the definition of the concept of "everyday thinking" which I am trying to capture - the one where nothing is true in general but everything is true in some context (and in which perceiving a statement often involves finding out the context in which it is true). Such a style of thinking, cannot be described by a single logical system. So what I am proposing in order to capture them is something else - a system of systems. 

A system of systems does not mean that the contexts aren't connected - it means that they are connected with something which is outside of them. Here is how my model works - first the brain learns (through heuristics) that some objects and actions from one system correspond to some objects and actions in another system. Once that correspondence is made, every time an object and action is recognized, all systems which have correspondence are fired. For example, when you see two apples, your brain immediately invokes mathematics and the concept of "two" which is recognized in the pattern you see. Then, if you decide to eat one of these apples, it invokes the concept of subtraction and based on those, it can tell you how many apples will you have left if you do that (so you can consider that when making a decision). 

These systems evolve as they get connected to one another. If you observe a given phenomena for a given time, you'd immediately form a logical system which encompasses it (for example, if you are faced with unfavorable circumstances, you'd start searching for a way to overcome them). It is most likely that this system will be based on some other system which you already use, so the difference between new systems and applications of existing ones is a question of semantics. But one thing is for sure - These two systems (the new one which you just created and the old one, on which it is based) are now reinforcing each other. Their concept of truth being related, they form a comfortable island in your consciousness where things agree with each other. 


In most people's brains there are a few of those, let's call them groups, consisting of systems which work in different contexts but which resemble one another reinforce one another based on these connections. The reinforcement based on resemblance is, I think the primary way in which the brain.
