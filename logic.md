Using logic to model the world of human perception
===


> "Hello, and welcome to another episode of "Logic for Y'all". Today we are going to tackle a rather controversial topic - using logic to model the world as it is perceived by us humans. Asked to comment on it, most people went: "Pff, logic!" and our resident logicians prepared the following summary: "Pff, the real world!". But still among our listeners there were some wannabe philosophers who insisted that this is the most important thing ever so it appears that we have no choice but to talk about it for some time (there will be booze at the end). So can we please give a warm welcome to the only guy who agreed to speak about this rubbish topic, Boris Marinoooov!"

Logic is a pretty misunderstood topic. It was originaly conceived as a way to model our thoughts so they are always correct, I think. Then some people tried to use it as a basis for describing mathematics. Then it was discovered that logic can be used for making computers and it was finaly useful (after existing for thousands of years). But today it looks like it is shifting away from its original purpose. 

Trying to make a logic analysis of an everyday conversation will reveal at once why this is the case - most of the think we say are neither logically sound, nor we expect or want them to be. What is a *logical* conversation anyways? Given a set of assumptions and a set rules for manipulating these assumptions, you can use logic to generate some other assumptions which will be true if the ones you are given are true. So a logical conversation would be something like:

> "Hm, it rained today. And had to go outside, so I got wet."
> "People get wet when it rains and they don't carry an umbrella. I guess you forgot your umbrella."

So logic covers a very small amount of the things that a human being will ever say, if any. In this text, I will attempt to find out why it is the case and try to extend logic so it can succeed in covering some more cases.
