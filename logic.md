Using logic to model real-world thinking
===


> "Hello, and welcome to another episode of "Logic for Y'all". Today we are going to tackle a rather controversial topic - "Using logic to model real-world thinking". Asked to comment on it, most people went: "Pff, logic!" and our resident logicians prepared the following summary: "Pff, the real world!". But still among our listeners there were some wannabe philosophers who insisted that this is the most important thing ever so it appears that we have no choice but to get someone to talk about it (there will be booze at the end). So can we please give a warm welcome to the only guy who agreed to speak about this rubbish topic, Boris Marinoooov!"

Logic is a pretty misunderstood topic. Some 2000 years old as a discipline, it has been used in many disciplines as mathematics, computer programming etc. but it has less and less to do with its original purpose - modelling the way we think to achieve correctness. And trying to use logic to analyse an everyday conversation will reveal at once why this is the case - most of the think we say are neither logically sound, nor we expect or want them to be. What is a *logical* conversation anyways? Given a set of assumptions and a set rules for manipulating these assumptions, you can use logic to generate some other assumptions. So a logical conversation would be something like:

> "Hm, it rained today. And had to go outside, so I got wet."
> "People get wet when it rains and they don't carry an umbrella. I guess you forgot your umbrella."

Nevertheless, it is clear that Aristotle was onto something when he invented the subject. So why isn't our thinking and conversations "logical" in the sense in which the above example is? The most obvious answer is that we do not strive for correctness in our thoughts and speech, so logic is just not useful for us, but for me this answer is wrong. What else can thinking be, but a strive for correctness? If we manage to think a thought, then it has to be correct in a certain sense and under certain rules. The question is what these rules are. 

The logic of real-world thinking
===

The first thing that I plan to do is to attempt to extend logic and define a system I can use it to model real-world thinking, that is perceiving the world around us and acting on these perceptions. 


The first step is to define what truth is. But in order to start the journey at all, we must first what flavour of logic we should use - classical or constructive. 

In search of true and false
---

In classical logic, True/False is an inherent characteristic of of each and every thing that we say. This is not at all how our perceptions and thoughts work - we constantly say and think things that are neither true nor false, or are somewhere in between. In constructive logic (or "Intuitionistic logic"as it is also called), things are a bit more "realistic" - True and False are just assertions like anything else and there can be statements which are neither True or False. For this reason I would pick constructive logic as a basis of my logical framework for modelling human perception.

If we are going to use constructive type of logic for modelling the world (and even if we aren't), we have to pick the core set of assertions that imply Truth. These assertions (or assertion) will act as the "seed" of our logical framework and everything else will follow from them. Let's start with the following statement: "everything that I see with my own eyes is true". From this it would follow that, for example, it is true that I am a human being, it is true that I am sitting in front of a computer etc. (I can see that I am standing in front a computer *and* everything I see is true, *therefore* I am sitting in front of a computer) etc. 

There are many statements that we cannot verify with our own eyes but we consider "true" in some sense, like mathematical statements, for example - simpler math statements like 1 + 1 = 2 may reside in the visible spectre, but there is no way to "see" that the square root of 2 is irrational, for example. Depending on your background, you may consider mathematics anything between the language of nature and a load of bullcrap. But one thing is for certain - mathematical statements are not true *in the same way* as statements about everyday objects that we see. Based on this statement, we can conclude that *in real-life thinking there are not one, but several concepts of truth and ways in which a given statement is true of false*. As we shall see later, actually the whole unique characteristic of thinking arises from the way in which those concepts connect. 

A system of systems
---

Our power to observe stuff is base source of truth, but there are an infinite number of other sources, such as truths based on scienses, not to mention ones based on belief (and by belief I don't mean just religious belief, which some people don't endourse, but belief in authorities, on which all people rely). Not all of these sources have to be so official as "Mathematically True" or "True as Observed" (or even as "It's in the Bible") - there are also stuff as trivial as "My Father Told me so" and a million other nameless ones. Each of these sources brings with itself its own notion of objects (such as "one", "God", and apple) a sets of logical operations for these objects ("plus", "sin", "eat"). In other words it brings a completely separate *logical system* which the brain can utilize in a given context. Because, not only does mathematics have its own concept of truth, it also has a unique method of reasoning, that is, of deciding whether a given proposition is true bases on other propositions.

My main claim with this article is that the brain rarely uses just one system to judge how to react in a given situation - it uses a multitude of systems (or even it can use one system in multitude of ways): in a single decision mathematics, religion, can all play a role, as well as one's sense of duty. This mash captures the concept of "everyday thinking" which I am trying to express. The one where nothing is true in general but everything is true in some context (and in which perceiving a statement often involves finding out the context in which it is true). 

Some notes on observation again
---

When we started, we said that there is one main source of truth, which is the truth based on observation. This is actually an oversimplification: there cannot be a logical system which is based *entirely* on observation - it has to contain some *interpretation* of that observation, e.g. a way to know where one object ends and when another begins. At the same time, *all systems that exist are based on observation to a lesser or larger extend*. So observation stuff is actually not a source of truth by itself, rather it is the light which illuminates all sources of truth.

Based on their relation to observation, logical systems form a tree.


How does it all add up
---
To complete our picture, we should somehow connect all those systems with one another. Probably the easiest way to do so is by featuring an object "X" called something like "Universal truth" from which all other truths would follow. This would effectively make all other truth objects subordinate to X (as they have to follow from it in order to be truth objects at all) and would make out picture much more simple and neat. For example to make a connection between two systems, all we have to do is see how they both relate to X. But I'd argue that *this is not how our brain works*. People who have chosen their X's, would say that I am wrong, or that I think so just because I haven't discovered X, but I rest my case - no matter how important X is for you, you are still sometimes thinking about things which have nothing to do with X, so saying that everything true follows from X, whatever X is would be incomplete at best. 

I claim that the brain rarely uses just one system to judge how to react in a given situation - it uses a multitude of systems (or even it can use one system in multitude of ways): a single decision can involve mathematics, religion, nurturing of one's sense of importance etc. And while this is not true for *every* decision, it is, I think the definition of the concept of "everyday thinking" which I am trying to capture - the one where nothing is true in general but everything is true in some context (and in which perceiving a statement often involves finding out the context in which it is true). Such a style of thinking, cannot be described by a single logical system. So what I am proposing in order to capture them is something else - a system of systems. 

A system of systems does not mean that the systems aren't connected - it means that they are connected with something which is outside of them. Here is how my model works - first the brain learns (through heuristics) that some objects and actions from one system correspond to some objects and actions in another system. Once that correspondence is made, every time an object and action is recognized, all systems which have correspondence are fired. For example, when you see two apples, your brain immediately invokes mathematics and the concept of "two" which is recognized in the pattern you see. Then, if you decide to eat one of these apples, it invokes the concept of subtraction and based on those, it can tell you how many apples will you have left if you do that (so you can consider that when making a decision). But I am going to end this chapter here, because all that happens outside the system itself.

More formally, we can represent a logical system by a Heyting algebra *S*, defined by one axiom *s* (or "source") such that *s -> t* for all statements *t*.


A connection between two systems *S -> S1* is a morphism between the two algebras.

Defining a "universal truth" would require placing the systems in a common order which 




Using our logical system
===

Now is the time to explain how did my little logical model came to be does the brain make decisions based on it. This explanation is not based on logic at all, as a matter of fact it is highly speculative, but I think that my idea won't be expressed clearly without it.

If you observe a given phenomena for a given amount of time, you may form a theory of how it "works" - this theory can, in most cases be reduced to a logical system which encompasses it. For example if you are hungry and you eat an apple, you are no longer hungry. If you are hungry and you eat a pea, you also stop being hungry. There is a system here, albeit very simple, based on the class of edible things. But how exactly does it comes to be - it is most likely that each new system that we create will be based on some other system which we already use. Whether the new system is really new is a question of semantics. But one thing is for sure - these two systems (the new one which you just created and the old one, on which it is based) are now reinforcing each other. Their concept of truth being related, they form a comfortable island in your consciousness where things agree with each other. This is the closest thing to a "univeral truth" that exists - a group of several systems which have a similar structure and all of them "work" in different contexts.

I did not say what it means for a system to "work". This is where the really speculative part comes. I think that it means for it to get a positive response from the body. The most primitive case is that correctly predicts a phenomena in a way that is beneficial for it. So I am not hungry any more, therefore the apple-eating system works. But sometimes the connection is more abstract, for example using systems which we use to communicate with other people, we can have the "dopamine kick", or the feeling of safety which suffocates our fear. There are classes of system, in which the positive response comes not due to positive outcome for the individual in the external world, but as a direct consequence of using the system itself. 

The last sentence touches a topic which is very important, namely that systems shape reality as much as they are created by it.

Instead of conclusion

Intelligence lies as much in creating and using systems, as much as it lies in knowing what they are and why they function.
