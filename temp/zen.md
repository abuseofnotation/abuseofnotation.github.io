Tell me I am smart, beautiful, capable.
None of this is true.
Tell me I am a cheat, liar and good for nothing.
None of this is true.

The only truth is the one you create in your mind, when you say these words.
And it will perish, with you and me.

So I pledge not to tell myself anything about myself.
As none of it will be true.


You ask me why I sit in silence.

Why do you talk?
Why do you listen to music?
Why do you read, watch videos and do anything else?

And most importantly, why do you seek justification from me for doing nothing.
Instead of seeking justification in yourself for doing things.
