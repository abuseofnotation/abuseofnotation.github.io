Human tech

Most of us agree that climate change is real. There are still many unanswered questions related to it, (as "How dangerous would it be?", "To what extend it is caused by us?" etc.), but while all these would be good to know, we have a more urgent things to do - if I tell you that there is a stone that is about to fall on your head that weights between 1 and 100 kilograms, your reaction wouldn't be to try to spend time determining the exact size of the stone, neither would you ask who's fault it is that it is there. You would just move (and that is what we, should do as a society.)

Obviously the solution of the problem has to do with *technology* (although technology is what got us here in the first place) and so many companies are trying to jump on that bandwagon and invent new less-polluting technologies that we call *green technologies*.

But I believe that what is today known as green technologies are not the answer
