"I could not remove my self-doubt (and neither I wanted to), and the dreadful feeling that my my life and everything I can possibly say or do is not worth anything, but if I tried to, I felt that I could lessen the feeling of pretence that I actually felt was at its (the self-doubt's) root. After all, why a person would even bother to feel self-doubt if they didn't take themselves too seriously in the first place? We only doubt the things that you rely on, and that is clearly not because there is no reason for us to doubt the rest, it is just that most of the time we would not bother ourselves with doing so, I guess other people were doing it just to keep their sanity? If so, then Caterina's ironic jesture was probably the best reaction to everything that I did in the last year (althought she herself was one hundred percent the same as me), I was no more brilliant than a person who attempts to build a house in a swamp and thinks that the reason other people missed that lovely spot of theirs was their superior perceptions and judgement.
