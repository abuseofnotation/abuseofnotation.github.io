THE NOTE

Hello, and sorry for the size. Most suicide notes seem kind of vague. They  rarely provide a descent explanation on why the hell did the man kill himself. I always thought how mean that was. Take Kurt Cobain’s note for example...

‘Wait, why on earth would I want to reference Kurt Cobain’ Johny scratched that last sentence. 

That is just mean. Bad enough that you friends and relatives have to face the shock of learing that you killed yourself, but the only response they receive for the entirely reasonable  question “Why?” is sheet of paper, containing scribbles of your pre-mortem moanings. Relax, friends, colleagues, enemies, and all else whom it may concern, I am better than that. So in the next pages you will find out exactly why I decided to end my life.

Now first I want to say that which every person who is about to kill himself ought to say, even if it is not true.
