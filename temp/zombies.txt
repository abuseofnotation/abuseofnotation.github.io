Song of the dead

Jack could not fall asleep, party because the bed was uncomfortable, and party because he knew that if he did, the General could wake him up any minute, and call him on his duty. He knew that, because it had happened several days ago. Part of his brain was still processing the moment when the General came:

- Wake up! We need you! - The had said.
- But isn’t…
- I know that you were supposed to rest. - He said. 
- But…
- Look, there is too many of them. What am _I_ supposed to do? - The General pleaded, once again showing that he was not a real military person. 

Neither was Jack, but still he stood up and began dressing.

In the beggining they functioned pretty much like a real army - they would split into platoons and would surround a horde of zombies and fire their shotguns at them, until they were all dead. They even had some combat strategies which, though poorly executed, made the whole thing seem more like a profession, as opposed to a struggle for survival.

Gradually, the discipline died out: They ran out of bullets, so they had to sway their enemies with knives, or any other sharp objects that they could find. They realised that  planning a combat against an enemy who has no plan, is as useless as the corpses of the zombies they killed. And last but not least, they lost a lot of men, which accounted for both more stress and longer working hours. So long that the last time Jack had some free time he didn’t even know what to do with it. So he spent his day just standing by the Gates and watching his colleagues slay the endless stream of zombies, and singing old marches from Word War Two, with rewritten lyrics.

As he stood, he toyed with the idea that there wasn’t much of a way to distinguish “his” side from theirs. From a distance there wasn’t a clearly visible border between the two. Plus you can be a human today, and a zombie tomorrow and with their increasing shortage of weapons soon there wasn’t going to be any real difference in how they fight.

- Get up! - Jack heard a sound that woke him up. - Get up now!
- I don't want to. - Jack said this, more like a factual statement, than a protest. 
- You don't want to? - The voice belonged to the general who seemed really pissed off. - Someone doesn't want to fight, someone doesn't want to get up! That's how we got to this point, kid!
- That is not how it happened.

The general used to work for the army. It was the army who released the virus that turned people into zombies. So if there was somebody in their city who held some responsibility for their situation, it was the General (athough he was just an accountant).

- Err.. OK, man. - The General stepped back. - No point in arguing. You know you will have to come anyways. 
- “…you will have to come anyways.” - Jack muttered while he was dressing. - You know mister, guys like _you_ got us to this point. Me, I was minding my own business. Like I plan to do now.
- You realise you will be sued for deserting?
- It's OK.

The general left and minute later two other man dragged Jack from his bed to the gates.

The situation there was almost hopeless. Just by looking at the landscape, Jack reckoned that not many of the soldiers will come back as human beings. The general was also there, along with the Judge and the Jury, who were still almost asleep.

- I hope that you already changed your mind. - The general said.
- Why do you think so? - Jack murmured.
- OK, fine! Then by the power invested in me, I accuse you of denying to fulfil your duty, under special circumstances. I will leave the matter to the law to handle!

The judge then approached, Jack. He was a very old man, so the General had to support him.

- Son. - He said. - Please, go there. Pretend you are fighting, if you will. It will all pass. And
