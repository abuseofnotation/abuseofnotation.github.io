A millenials thoughts on the new millenium - a left-wing propaganda.
===

In a society where more people believe that the Earth is flat than that capitalism is not the final economical and political paradigm, writing an essay like this one is not an easy task. Many people would probably think I am doing it just because  I did not get the memo that market economy is the best and is here to stay. And even more would be the ones who will just dismiss this article - why should there be interested in politics at all. After all, nobody is paying them to do so, right? 

In an attempt to be heard, many people who probably feel the same way as me and have the same motivation would try to equivocate when they talk about that, or to try to change other people's opinion one step at the time by, for example, starting with advocating the funding of public services like health care and education and then for basic income etc. I won't try to do that, I am not saying that this is the wrong approach (who knows if it is) but I neither like it nor do I have enough time to pursue it, so I won't try to equivocate. If you think that, "communism does not work", or "capitalism is bad, but there isn't anything better" and you aren't ready to challenge these assumptions probably won't find anything interesting here.

Social structures, past and present. 
===

When I talk about capitalism, I won't be talking just about the characteristics political system which is capitalism and its characteristics such as the practice of free trade, the idea that the market regulates itself etc. Rather, I will talk about the social structure which enables this system to exist (talking about just the political system in isolation would be incomplete and, in most cases, decebtfull). What do I mean by a social structure? For me it conststs of three main elements which play along in order to keep the status quo: At the heart of every social structure is a *mythos*, an origin story a purpose-giving narative - something which people believe in order to keep each other together as a society. As every mythos, this story is neither true nor false and its not meant to be evaluated by its truth or falcity. You can either live according to it or not. Then, there is the *political system* itself. Every political system has a rulling class. Much of the political system are the rules under which this group operates and based on which its members gain and lose power. The mythos should, in one way or another, justify the political system, otherwise, people just wouldn't want to play along and there would be no society. 

The third important element is a social group which I will call the "mediators". Those are the people who have the job to explain to the people how every decision of the ruling class fits into the big picture of the mythos, thus justifying it.

The ruling class itself can help the mediators but it cannot do their job by itself. Seeing the ruling class trying to take upon the role of the mediators, is a sure sign that their actions are not really justifiable by the mythos. In other words, society has a problem which, although the ruling class would try to convince you that it can be solved by hiring and firing a few of its members, is really an indicator that the days of the political system, and even the mythos, are numbered. Along this line of thinking, we may deem the mediators the most important element of a social structure - and bad ruler can always be replaced, but if there are no people who are willing to support the system, the whole runing class is powerless.

Let's test our little theory by examining monarchy - a social structure which is obsolete enough for us to have an unbiased perspective of it. The monarchy mythos: kings are (descendants of) gods. Therefore they not only know what is good for you, but alko know what is *right* i.e. what can gurantee you a spot in heaven. So obsolete is monarchy, that it is hard for us to imagine how its *mythos* had any effect on people. But try to look through the eyes of a person living in the middle-ages - poor, illiterate, working 12 hours a day for one bread, looking upon a man who lives in a wonderful castle, who has never worked in his life. Surely this person cannot be the same as you, right?

The *mediators* in monarchy were the clergy, who have a hotline with God and which, once they get a response from him, give their blessing to the next king, using obscure rituals. The * political system* was simple - because the king knows best, he can appoint the rulling class by himself. As simple and rudimentary this system was, it did work at many times and places. Its success is, for me, a testament to the fact that a system does not have to be complex in order to "work". The most important factor is probably the good balance between the ruling class and the mediators, i.e. having a clergy who has high morale and cares about the people.

What came after monarchy is the idea of a secular state and of democracy. Again, we will start with the mythos, which, as that of monarchy, may seem surprising to us, but for different reasons - democracy's *mythos* is the idea that people are equal and that they themselves have not only the ability, but the right to decide what's best for them - it is an idea which seems obvious, but it really isn't and even today there are few societies where really everyone are considered equal and no-one is excluded. 

The *system* of democracy is that the ruling class is appointed by the people based solemnly on skill. 

The role of the mediator is played by the *media* - the free press, accompanied by the education institutions, which holds the ruling class accountable and criticises it.

It is hard to criticise democracy, as it looks like (and probably is) exactly like the social structure that we should be uniting ourselves around, but when comparing it with monarchy, we can see one fatal flaw - democracy is incomplete. In particular, its *mythos* lacks a firm ideologic grounds. While monarchy always rests on the firm ideology of a religion, democracy just allows everyone to follow their own doctrines and does not give a direction as to how a state should function. Under democracy, we agree on what is good, but not on what is right for us. It does not tell us why are we together which, as obsolete as it sounds, is absolutely instrumental for having a functional society. An example of societies without a firm ideology are the authoritarian regimes of the 20th century, like the Third Reich. Although the leaders of such regimes talk about ideology all the time, their "ideology" consists of just a couple of slogans, whose constant repetition cannot make up for their insubstantiality, nor can the criminalization of their criticism make up for their many inconsistencies.

A social structure and its ideology are not only related - they are the same thing, just as "the medium is the message", as McLuhan says. A new ideology can easily drive a change in the social structure and the lack of a proper social structure could immediately make an ideology obsolete. In other words, if we have a functional society, we have an ideology.

I would call the current ideology which supplements our democratic society capitalism (or "consumerism" in order to differentiate it from the purely economic aspect of the former term). In terms of economy, capitalism is just the ability of people to own trade goods freely - something a form of which existed for centuries. In terms of ideology, I'd say it is characterised with the practice of putting a price tag on everything, as the ultimate merit of value. Capitalism is democracy's bastard child which ended up killing its father. But in order to understand how that happened, let's first examine how did it evolve in the form in which it did.

From democracy to capitalism
===

The process of forming a new ideology after the decline of aristrocracy wasn't a straightforward one. People did not overthrow monarchy for ideological reasons. Their main motivation for doing so was the fact that their basic survival was threatened. Although they were still religious, people were hungry and they weren't ready to wait until they die for a better life - they wanted that better life ASAP. In other words, when builing the new democratic society, people were driven by survival instincts. When turning into a full-blown ideology, these instincts became the new values of the new democratic society: values human rights, security, stability, progress etc. and then they converged into one thing - money. How and why did that happen is a question which can be disputed, but the fact that it happened, for me, cannot.


What happens next

The rise of the smartphone market is a perfect example of how capitalism works. A new market is usually pioneered by small company and there are a lot of innovation, but gradually the business shifts in the hands of bigger and bigger companies and the focus becomes uniformity. At first there were a lot of different products with different operating systems, different types of touch technologies, different types of keyboards etc. There were many innovative ideas (build-in projectors, 3D screens, removable modules on phones). Currently we basically have one model. The only unique feature I can think of (one which is not on every phone that is being manifactured) is the stylus. The only innovation that we saw in the past year is adding a few millimeters to the size of the screen and a notch which renders the said extra millimeters useless, in many respects. The next innovation that we will likely see is the removal of the said notch. And there are a lot more money invested in marketing, people paid to convince us that the new products are actually better and that we need the marginal (or nonexisting) gains that they would provide us.


Why is this happening? The reason is, "sustainability", as business people call it, or more simply, because of their fear of change. The traditional fairy tale of capitalism goes like this. Individuals have needs, businesses want to make money, individuals are willing to pay more for products that better meet their needs, so the better a business is at satisfying people's needs, the richer it becomes. However, that fairy tale misses one important detail - the interests of an *organization*, aren't always formed by the interests of the *people who form it* (it can be the other way around). A big organization is not only dependent on the people involved in it. A big organization has policies, procedures, it is organized by departments, each of which has a specific purpose etc. In a big organization, employees cannot just get together in a room and decide that they have been doing it all wrong.

Now back to motivations. Individuals are indeed motivated by money, as we all know, but I don't think businesses, especially big ones are motivated making more money:

1. They have quite enough of it already.
2. They cannot make much more than they are making already.

For big businesses success can actually lead to a whole range of bad consequences, like being perceived as bad monopolists and like antithrust lawsuits. Instead, they are interested in something else - keeping the status quo, that is minimizing any chance that they lose their market share, position, capitalization etc. In other words, businesses want everything to stay as it is. From their point of view innovation is expensive and risky. It disrupts the situation in ways where it is not clear who will have the upper hand. It creates new markets, where new players might pop up. It can lead to "canibalization" (a process in which a given product line of one company is growing at the expence of another product line of the same company). In short innovation benefits individuals, but not businesses.

"But how does all that even matter, if "the customer is always right"?", a capitalist fairy tale teller might ask. According to them, the customers dictate how the market would develop and businesses *need* to act in the best interest of their customers, else they would just crumble. This is probably true in the first stage of maturity of a given market. For example, when smartphones were a novelty item, business did do everything to capture people's interest. This was back when people "wanted" to have a smartphones ...and before they thought they "needed" them. At the second stage, the stage when your customer "needs" the product, the rules of the game change completely. Actually this need for a specific product is probably in the root of this whole phenomena. We've all experienced it: it is like hunger, but not just for any food. It is like the desire to say something, but only on a specific media, using a specific device. Effectively the individual is so used to the product or service that they get that they are not interested in anything different. It is a desire that resembles addiction. Big companies often develop features which perpetuate such desires, such as displays with higher and higher resolutions (after a certain point a more pixels won't enable you to perceive the content better, they would only make you hate your older lower-resolution displays. Another example of this is using unrealisticly bright colors (this is a technique which was firstly used by makers beverages and cleaning products), for this reason why I always keep my displays on grayscale.

What effectively happens is that individuals start adopting the same values as organizations such as fear of change and support for the status quo. Which is bad, because these values do not benefit us as individuals. For a person, lack of change means boredom and despair. Change is our life, being afraid of change is being afraid of life.
