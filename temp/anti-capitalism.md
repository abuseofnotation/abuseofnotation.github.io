The rise of the smartphone market is a perfect example of how capitalism works. A new market is usually pioneered by small company and there are a lot of innovation, but gradually the business shifts in the hands of bigger and bigger companies and the focus becomes uniformity. At first there were a lot of different products with different operating systems, different types of touch technologies, different types of keyboards etc. There were many innovative ideas (build-in projectors, 3D screens, removable modules on phones). Currently we basically have one model. The only unique feature I can think of (one which is not on every phone that is being manifactured) is the stylus. The only innovation that we saw in the past year is adding a few millimeters to the size of the screen and a notch which renders the said extra millimeters useless, in many respects. The next innovation that we will likely see is the removal of the said notch. And there are a lot more money invested in marketing, people paid to convince us that the new products are actually better and that we need the marginal (or nonexisting) gains that they would provide us.

Why is this happening? The reason is, "sustainability", as business people call it, or more simply, because of their fear of change. The traditional fairy tale of capitalism goes like this. Individuals have needs, businesses want to make money, individuals are willing to pay more for products that better meet their needs, so the better a business is at satisfying people's needs, the richer it becomes. However, that fairy tale misses one important detail - the interests of an *organization*, aren't always formed by the interests of the *people who form it* (it can be the other way around). A big organization is not only dependent on the people involved in it. A big organization has policies, procedures, it is organized by departments, each of which has a specific purpose etc. In a big organization, employees cannot just get together in a room and decide that they have been doing it all wrong.

Now back to motivations. Individuals are indeed motivated by money, as we all know, but I don't think businesses, especially big ones are motivated making more money:

1. They have quite enough of it already.
2. They cannot make much more than they are making already.

For big businesses success can actually lead to a whole range of bad consequences, like being perceived as bad monopolists and like antithrust lawsuits. Instead, they are interested in something else - keeping the status quo, that is minimizing any chance that they lose their market share, position, capitalization etc. In other words, businesses want everything to stay as it is. From their point of view innovation is expensive and risky. It disrupts the situation in ways where it is not clear who will have the upper hand. It creates new markets, where new players might pop up. It can lead to "canibalization" (a process in which a given product line of one company is growing at the expence of another product line of the same company). In short innovation benefits individuals, but not businesses.

"But how does all that even matter, if "the customer is always right"?", a capitalist fairy tale teller might ask. According to them, the customers dictate how the market would develop and businesses *need* to act in the best interest of their customers, else they would just crumble. This is probably true in the first stage of maturity of a given market. For example, when smartphones were a novelty item, business did do everything to capture people's interest. This was back when people "wanted" to have a smartphones ...and before they thought they "needed" them. At the second stage, the stage when your customer "needs" the product, the rules of the game change completely. Actually this need for a specific product is probably in the root of this whole phenomena. We've all experienced it: it is like hunger, but not just for any food. It is like the desire to say something, but only on a specific media, using a specific device. Effectively the individual is so used to the product or service that they get that they are not interested in anything different. It is a desire that resembles addiction. Big companies often develop features which perpetuate such desires, such as displays with higher and higher resolutions (after a certain point a more pixels won't enable you to perceive the content better, they would only make you hate your older lower-resolution displays. Another example of this is using unrealisticly bright colors (this is a technique which was firstly used by makers beverages and cleaning products), for this reason why I always keep my displays on grayscale.

What effectively happens is that individuals start adopting the same values as organizations such as fear of change and support for the status quo. Which is bad, because these values do not benefit us as individuals. For a person, lack of change means boredom and despair. Change is our life, being afraid of change is being afraid of life.
