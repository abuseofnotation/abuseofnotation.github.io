In deterministic systems, non-deterministic events can be only explained by "hidden variables" theories, that basiclly say that the only reason why you didn't predict something is that you are not good enough and you don't know enough - this is a good stance to adopt for evolutionary reasons, as it constantly pushes us to analyse and systematize everything around us, but it's bad when we take it too seriously and start dedicating too much effort to it.

The beliefs in "determinism", "causality", and the concepts of the world and the future are all strongly related - it is almost as if they are the 

Kant

For this reason statements like `All A-s are B`, despite the way that beside `A` and `B` such statements reference a third object - the world. Let's examine the way thinking evolves from limited-scope to universal, using Immanuel Kant's table of categories, that he laid down in his book "The Critique of Pure Reason" (and which are based on the main logical judgements). 

Immanuel Kant split the pure concepts of the understanding into four classes called quantity, quality, relation and modality and notably each class contains 3 categories, instead of 2, the third member being, according to the author, a combination of the other two.

Quality
- Reality 
- Negation 
- **Limitation**

Relation
- Inherence and subsistence 
- Causality and dependence 
- **Community**

Modality
- Possibility - Impossibility 
- Existence - Non-existence 
- **Necessity - Contingency**

Here is what the author says about he third members of each category:

> II. The number of the categories in each class is always the same, namely, three—a fact which also demands some consideration, because in all other cases division à priori through conceptions is necessarily dichotomy. It is to be added, that the third category in each triad always arises from the combination of the second with the first.
> Thus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity; limitation is merely reality conjoined with negation; community is the causality of a substance, reciprocally determining, and determined by other substances; and finally, necessity is nothing but existence, which is given through the possibility itself. Let it not be supposed, however, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not a primitive conception of the pure understanding. For the conjunction of the first and second, in order to produce the third conception, requires a particular function of the understanding, which is by no means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second. Thus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category of totality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude and unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite). Or, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, it does not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how one substance can be the cause of something in another substance, will be understood from that. Thus it is evident that a particular act of the understanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances.

Ideas
===

- Lawfulness VS continuity

Active intuition
- The human's desire for control
- The notion of the world as something that can be modelled.
- Instructions as a way to model the world
- Unordered states, defined as "uninterpreted states" and the role of the subject/observer as the "creator of order"


On the concept of the self, the human's desire for control and the self-enforcement of deterministic subsystems, due to mental images and goals which are mistaken for the actual world.
===

Our stance as humans, however *is not like this* as some of these images are clearly embedded into our minds.


The idea of God is not merely delusion created to help cope with the fear of death (although it does help people cope with the fear of death), but it is a personification to the aspect of reality that does not adhere to the causality maxim and that is unknowable. Religious rituals can be rationalized using the following argument: although we cannot really be familiar with the aspect of reality which is unknowable, we must pay tribute to it, in order not to forget of its existence.

The idea of the self is probably closer to a delusion than that of God, but it is a personification of that which is knowable - your persona, your job, the things you know and believe are you. Any habit thought or urge that is outside of this narrative is not really a part of the self. And that is not because such habits/thoughts/urges are rare. Neither because they are better, worse or in any way different than the rest of your habits/thoughts/urges. They are not part of the self for precisely that reason - they are not a part the narrative.


The self is not who you are, but who you want to be (your projected goal).


Mental images are self-enforced over time, this is why older people as a rule are more dogmatic than younger ones.

It is not about older people having more knowledge (real knowledge will make you less dogmatic if anything), it's about having more dogmas 

The society's spell
- Computers
- We create our own world.

On the unity of the great nothingness

On the lack of goal as a goal.
===

- Perception of time as a fractal 
- The lack of ideology as ideology.
- On mistakes
- On problems

Takeaways
===

Don't focus too much to particular interpretations of reality and to the aspect of reality which is ultimately known as based on these interpretations - instead go to 

Don't focus on being happy and on knowing yourself - there is no self. Focus on something else instead.

Don't compare things in terms of quantity, instead, compare them in terms of quality.

Focus on the process of what you do, instead of the outcome.

> Mental images are abstractions, they can be used without a loss of precision only when you can keep in mind what are they and from what are they produced from. 

Buying more stuff will not bring you closer to happiness, just like living longer years will not bring you closer to immortality.

In order to drop suffering, you have to drop happiness too.

Confusion makes you forget the way.

On the true nature of reality 
===

All events which we withness must be connected with one another forming what is known as a causality chain (or chains). 

An event that does not cause any other event as per their causal chain simply cannot be perceived by us, so in many ways, placing the event in the causal chain is perception itself.

This is why, in our everyday thinking, we often refer to all things that we talk about as either real or unreal (just like in logic we split statements to true and false) e.g. Stephen Hawking is real and Professor Charles Francis Xavier is not. 

This line of thought, however is too naive. To see why, one just has to look at a more abstract concept, e.g. is true love real, and does it exist? It all depends on how you define it, and defining it in too robust terms is impossible, as the definition would rely on many other concepts.

the "realness" of a concept is not just a matter of whether something exist or does not you had or had not seen something which resembles it, but a matter of how much does the concept resonate with the concepts that constitute our worldview. In other words, it is not a yes/no question. The degree of realness, we can also call the degree of *anticipation of perception* i.e. considering an object real means that you anticipate to sense it. Although it seems counter intuitive at first, the anticipation of perseption actually comes *before the perception* - only after we are ready to and prepared to perceive something, we may actually come to realise that it is actually there (this statement may seem paradoxical, but as we said perception itself is paradoxical).

The black hole example is appropriate here. Earlier, we said that the black holes' existence was postulated before actual objects were observed. But does that mean that we are to regard them (before they were actually observed) as absolutely unreal? According to this line of thought no - if the theories that postulate their existence were supported by *some evidence from observation* i.e. there were some way in which these theories fitted into the more general framework of knowledge of the field, then they should be viewed as "somewhat real", as opposed to "imaginary".

Moreover, there are aspects of black holes, which are not yet observed (and some that, are considered *unobservable*). Black holes still might not be exactly what we think they are. Therefore we cannot claim that they (our current notion of them) are 100% real.
