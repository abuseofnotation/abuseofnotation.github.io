Determinism as the default world view
- Contours of reality
- Unpredictability is actually reality's defining characteristic, as it is what differentiates it from fiction.



Active intuition
- The human's desire for control
- The notion of the world as something that can be modelled.
- Instructions as a way to model the world

The society's spell
- Computers


Zen mind
- Perception of time as a fractal 
- The lack of ideology as ideology.
- On mistakes
- On problems

Takeaways
===

Don't focus too much to particular interpretations of reality and to the aspect of reality which is ultimately known as based on these interpretations - instead go to 

Don't focus on being happy and on knowing yourself - there is no self. Focus on something else instead.

Don't compare things in terms of quantity, instead, compare them in terms of quality.

Focus on the process of what you do, instead of the outcome.

Goals and predicting the future
===

> A goal is a mental image representing state a of affairs which is for some reason desirable for an individual.

Rudimentary organisms that have no brain or have a very rudimentary brain perceive and react only by the stimulus-reaction model - they perceive an object in aframe and react on it immediately (a frame and an object being roughly the same thing in this case).

The most rudimentary types of memories are just a cartrige that get inserted into the organism's stimulis-reaction model in that they just associate a new stimulus to a desired reaction, e.g. seeing a predator to running away. Such memories do not require for an organism to have concepts of time and causality in order to exist, because they: 
- Do not constitute sequences of actions or events 
- Are not composed of multiple steps 
- They are not related to one another in any way i.e. there is no before and after.

Those memories are just like in the stimulus-reaction model, except the reactions can be altered based on experience (i.e. they are not just genetic).

Probably the next stage of the development of the concept of time was the desire to predicting the future. Indeed, this desire is probably prior to the concept of future itself as having a concept of the future as such makes sense only if you are able to predict what that future might be.

But predicting the future requires more than just taking stale pictures of things and storing what you need to do in case a similar situation arises. It requires you to model the whole world. This is what the concept of causality does and this is why it exists - to bring everything that we see to our own terms.  


> All mental images that a given individual has, are, for them, either desirable or the opposite - undesirable - we cannot have a mental image that we don't relate to with either positive or negative feelings. So all mental images are trivially associated with, or are themselves goals (or anti-goals). 

The only way to compare mental images is by their utility as means of achieving different types of goals. And comparing the mental images is a converged way of comparing the goals to which they stand.

Having once produced a mental image or a goal an individual starts mistaking a mental image for reality and prescribing all instances where the image does not correspond with reality as due to issues with the instances themselves and not to the image (for example by saying "the pistol does break the glass *in principle*", it is just that this one is too thick/not of the "right" kind etc). 


According to this line of thought, that causality is not a rule, nor a meta rule, but a belief and one that every thinking being should hold to some extend or another.
