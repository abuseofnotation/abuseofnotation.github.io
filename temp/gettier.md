Epistemology for y'all: Was Gettier a fraud?

Yesterday, while browsing through the Wikipedia page on epistemology I came across the following exerpt:

> Edmund Gettier is best known for his 1963 paper entitled Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?, which called into question the theory of knowledge that had been dominant among philosophers for thousands of years.[19] This in turn called into question the actual value of philosophy if such an obvious and easy counterexample to a major theory could exist without anyone noticing it for thousands of years.

I did not know anything about either Edmund Gettier or the paper, but the way this paragraph attacked not only all philosophers but philosophy as a discipline left me infuriated, so without doing much research, I deleted it, stating that "you can easily see many examples of philosophers claiming similar issues". If I wanted to get into more detail, I would have added that I don't think that there is such thing as a "dominant theory" in philosophy and especially such that has no counterexamples- philosophy, after all, is about arguments, so you really want to you can always construct arguments to support even the stupidest thesis (which was what I was planning to do if someone attacked me for messing with Wikipedia's epistemology page).

Gettier's problem
===

Of course, I went through Gettier's paper before doing all that to ensure that it wasn't as ground-breaking as described. The few minutes I spent on it reaffirmed my belief that there isn't, and that there probably would not ever be, anything ground-breaking in this field. Gettier's idea was to attack a specific notion of knowledge - that of justified true belief. So the "dominant theory of knowledge" as described in the paragraph I deleted is basically the notion that if you believe that something is true and that that something is actually true, then we can say that you *know* that this something is true. This is something that clearly would bother many many philosophers who lived and died long before Gettier. But let's go through his argument: 

> Suppose that Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job. And suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the following conjunctive proposition: (d) Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his pocket.
> Smith's evidence for (d) might be that the president of the company assured him that Jones would, in the end, be selected and that he, Smith, had counted the coins in Jones's pocket ten minutes ago. Proposition (d) entails: (e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.
> Let us suppose that Smith sees the entailment from (d) to (e), and accepts (e) on the grounds of (d), for which he has strong evidence. In this case, Smith is clearly justified in believing that (e) is true.
> But imagine, further, that unknown to Smith, he himself, not Jones, will get the job. And, also, unknown to Smith, he himself has ten coins in his pocket. Proposition (e) is true, though proposition (d), from which Smith inferred (e), is false. In our example, then, all of the following are true: (i) (e) is true, (ii) Smith believes that (e) is true, and (iii) Smith is justified in believing that (e) is true. But it is equally clear that Smith does not know that (e) is true; for (e) is true in virtue of the number of coins in Smith's pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in his pocket, and bases his belief in (e) on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.

Logical analisis
===

To me it seems like the article has many superfluous details. Because it uses logical language, let's try to strip it down to a logical problem:

We start with the proposition (d), which is false

> (d) Jones will get the job, and Jones has ten coins. 

And from it we remove the name "Jones" and get a more general proposition (e), which happens to be true.

> (e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket. 

And author claims that (e) is a justified true belief, but not knowledge.

I claim that distilling the argument to its logical form does not do it any justice -  
knowing that (d) is false, we can hardly call statements that follows from it "justified". The fact that (d) had some grain of truth in it is irrellevant. [Every logical statement follows from contradictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion). Does not mean that every (and any) statement is justified?

So all the confusion in the example stems from the fact that our hero made an error from the start - namely the statement "Jones will get the job" is false. Everything following that error is not really worth discussing because, as we said, we can make any conclusion from false premises. 

Knowledge - the gist of it all
===

So, while the logical method did help us dissect the Gettier problem and understand it much better, it did little to unveil why it is considered so important. From the logician's viewpoint it seems like Gettier does not add anything substantial to the much earlier examples of similar logical problems, like the following one which is written in 770 CE by the Indian philosopher Dharmottara:

> Imagine that we are seeking water on a hot day. We suddenly see water, or so we think. In fact, we are not seeing water but a mirage, but when we reach the spot, we are lucky and find water right there under a rock. Can we say that we had genuine knowledge of water? The answer seems to be negative, for we were just lucky.

Quote taken from the [Stanford Philosophy Encyclopedia](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/knowledge-analysis/)

When we look at the bigger picture, statement (d) ("Jones will get the job") is not just any false statement - it is a statement that we have very serious grounds to believe. We may be 99% sure that it is true. And we are 100% sure that (e) is true - why isn't that enough to say we *know* it? This question is precisely the key to understanding what the Gettier problem is about - it isn't about logic. It's about the concepts 

And "justified true belief" is more than a definition of knowledge - it is an idea of what knowledge is or can be. And one which resonted and probably still resonates perfectly the way many people think about knowledge, but which is totally misleading. 

Consider this: if we say that knowledge is "justified true belief" then statement (d) from Gettier's argument ("Jones will get the job") is *not* knowledge as, although justified, it is not true. And it does not make sense for us to justify knowledge using non-knowledge, which means that not only isn't "justified true belief" a good definition of knowledge - but the phrase "justified true belief" is by itself contradictory.

The only way to justify our true beliefs is to use knowledge that we know to be 100% true by some other means (e.g. God told us) in these cas everything that follows from those pieces and is also true will be knowledge only due to the fact that it is justified true belief (although one can argue that the "true" condition will be redundant as anything which follows from something which is 100% true must be also 100% true). This means that behind every "justified true belief" presented as knowledge, lies a hidden assumptions. But hidden assumptions are not knowledge.

The problem of induction
===

Let's go back to Gettier's example and see how he begins talking about (d):

> Smith's evidence for (d) might be that the president of the company assured him that Jones would, in the end, be selected and that he, Smith, had counted the coins in Jones's pocket ten minutes ago.

So Smith's evidence for assumption (d) is based on other assumptions e.g. "the president of the company makes the decision all by himself", "the president of the company does not lie" "Jones' pockets don't have holes in them" and countless others. And the only way to justify *those* assumptions will require for us to make some more and more general assumptions (we may, for example say that "The president does not lie because he is a devoted Christian"). The deeper we go, the more clearly we see the principle: you can only justify a particular, you must know a principle which is more general than it (i.e. deductive reasoning). So in order to 

This brings us way back in time, to a problem which is often attributed to David Hume, but which actually is due to a philosopher called Sextus Empiricus who lived in the year 160 CE.

> When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite.

Or to rephrase it using our example: if we propose to establish that Jones will get the job, we can either review all or some of the factors of him getting it. But if we review only some of the factors i.e. (the opinion of the president of the company) we may be wrong, while reviewing all of them is impossible.

Was Gettier a fraud: instead of conclusion
===

> According to the inherited lore of the epistemological tribe, the JTB [justified true belief] account enjoyed the status of epistemological orthodoxy until 1963, when it was shattered by Edmund Gettier... Of course, there is an interesting historical irony here: it isn't easy to find many really explicit statements of a JTB analysis of knowledge prior to Gettier. It is almost as if a distinguished critic created a tradition in the very act of destroying it.
