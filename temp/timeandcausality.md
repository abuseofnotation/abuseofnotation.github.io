Time is perceived as discreet by us - we can view the *input* which our brain receives and from which the perception of time and continuity is derived as a collection of frames, pictures of different states of reality which are, somehow, united. 

There is no global and universal time clocks imply, only local and subjective time which different brains perceive for themselves.

In order for the perception of time to be realised, the list of frames must be interpreted as signifying some sort of change of object from one state to another, like change of position (motion), change of shape, change color etc.

1. But if the frames are all alike (like if you are standing facing a wall) you would not be able to perceive change (and time). 

2. But if the frames are all different and don't have anything to do with each other, you also wouldn't be able to perceive change. 

To perceive change, then, your must be able to interpret the frames in such a way that there is an aspect of them which is different for each frame but at the same time stays the same for all of them i.e. to postulate the *identity* of objects and events.

The basic form of identity of events and objects (objects being just collections of events) is *causality* - when observing event `A` in a given frame followed by another event `B` at another frame, we presume that `A ⇒ B` (`B` is caused by `A`) e.g. when I see a given object standing on my desk and then I see a similar object in the next moment it is probably the same object. This is the main way identity is perceived by people e.g. a ship that has all it's parts changed at a course of a given period is still the same ship it was at the beginning of the said period, although different in terms of material.

As the above example hints, causality is in the eye of the beholder i.e. `A ⇒ B` is not a fact about the world, but a mental construct. This is so, because `B` is party defined by its internal characteristics but it is party defined as just "the thing that comes after `A`" (if `B` just happens without any sign of `A` before it, to what extend would it still be `B`?). In the same way, `A` is partly defined as the thing that comes after some other event. In order to perceive them, all events have to be connected to one another in the causal chain.

Let's imagine that we know that `A ⇒ B` and we observe `A` and then observe another event `B'` which resembles `B` in terms of some of its internal characteristics, but is also different in other characteristics (as all events are different from one another). In this case we have two choices:

1. We may presume that because it follows from `A`, `B'` must be some manifestation of `B` and thus expand the definition of `A ⇒ B` to include this new manifestation.
2. We may conclude  that `A` is not actually `A`, but some other event `A'` and thus discover a new fact about the world - `A' ⇒ B`.

The first kind of thinking is called dogmatic, the second one - empirical. Only when thinking empirically, do we obtain information about the world. Only when thinking dogmatically do we use the information about the world that we have gained.
