On causality as the defining principle of all knowledge
===

> 0 We can view the *input* which our brain receives and from which the perception of time and continuity is derived as a collection of frames, pictures of different states of reality which are, somehow, united.

> 1 In order for the perception of time to be realised, the list of frames must be interpreted as signifying some sort of change of object from one state to another, like change of position (motion), change of shape, color etc.

- If the frames are all alike (like if you are standing facing a wall) you would not be able to perceive change (and time). 

- But if the frames are all different i.e. don't have anything to do with each other, you also wouldn't be able to perceive change. 

To perceive change, then, we must be able to interpret the frames in such a way that there is an aspect of them which is different for each frame but at the same time stays the same for all of them i.e. we have to postulate the *identity* of objects and events. 

> 2 The basic form of identity of events and objects (objects being just collections of events) is based on the concept of *causality* - when observing event `A` in a given frame followed by another event `B` at another frame, we presume that `A ⇒ B` (`B` is caused by `A`).**

What this means is that identity and causality are the same thing - when I see a given object standing on my desk and then I see a similar object in the next moment I assume that it is probably the same object i.e. the object being there at time X *causes* it to be there at time x + 1. There are other ways for defining identity (technically, for example, an object is the same only if it contains the same atoms), but this is the main way it is perceived by people, hence the old parable about a ship that has all it's parts changed at a course of a given period is still the same ship it was at the beginning of the said period, although different in terms of material. 

The subjectiveness of causality and the paradoxical nature of all knowledge
===

> 3. Causality is in the eye of the beholder i.e. `A ⇒ B` is not a fact about the world, but a mental construct. This is so, because `B` is party defined by its internal characteristics but it is also party defined as just "the thing that comes after `A`" (if `B` just happens without any sign of `A` before it, to what extend would it still be `B`?). In the same way, `A` is partly defined as the thing that comes after some other event.

Let's imagine that we know that `A ⇒ B` and we observe `A` and then observe another event `B'` which resembles `B` in terms of some of its internal characteristics, but is also different in some other characteristics (note that this is not a mere thought experiment, as all events are different from one another). 

In this case we have two choices:

- We may presume that because it follows from `A`, `B'` must be some manifestation of `B` and thus expand the definition of `A ⇒  B` to include this new manifestation.

- We may conclude  that `A` is not actually `A`, but some other event `A'` and thus discover a new fact about the world - `A' ⇒  B'`.

The first kind of thinking is called dogmatic, the second one - empirical. Only when thinking empirically, do we *obtain* information about the world. Only when thinking dogmatically are we able to *use* the information about the world that we have gained.

From the previous example we saw that dogmas like `A ⇒ B` are not truths, they are just rules for structuring information. Sometimes we naively sometimes think of them as true when they mostly "work" i.e. allow us to achieve a given goal or false, but the fact is that they are not - instances that follow a given rule may only follow it by accident, or because we perceive them as following it. Instances that don't follow the rule are simply not instances of that rule - no rule is right or wrong.

Natively we may think of causality and of `A ⇒  B` as true, because when we perceive `A`, then (in the most cases) we also perceive `B` and it is easier to explain that by postulating causality than to just say it happens by accident (Occam's razor). This may lead us to believe that causality is some kind of law that exist in the world, or rather a meta-law, which implies the existence of all kinds of other laws. In this case, we would be overlooking the fact that: 
> `B` is not a specific state of affairs, it is just a mental image, a pattern *we* begin to search for given our previous knowledge of `A ⇒  B`.

We search for `B` and often do find it even without there being perfect candidates - If we already think that `A ⇒  B` we will see `B` everywhere we see `A`. In this case we say that someone sees `B` *even when it is not really there*", but the fact of the matter is we cannot possibly see anything that *is* there in the way that we see `B` in this example. 


so I will try to If we view the causal maxim as a scientific theory we might put it to the test using some of the many occasions in which it is used, using the scientific method. How would we do that. We can for example take a statement that has the form `A ⇒  B` and try to test it by creating `A` many times and seeing if `B` follows i.e. every science experiment that tests whether a given theory works also tests whether causality works.

From these examples it may seem that causality is a law which sometimes works and sometimes does not. People believe that the only reason it not always works is that we simply don't know enough is proven false by the evidence that the world is non-deterministic, which is laid in some quantum mechanic experiments (the world is non-deterministic" is another way of saying that all science theories that exist and that can ever be created are just abstractions that will never get to the heart of the matter). But let's not get ahead of ourselves. 

To test causality, I suggest the following experiment which uses everyday logic and objects: a pistol is turned to a window. The pistol's trigger is pressed, therefore the window should be broken.

But what if there is no bullet in the pistol? OK, let's make it a *loaded* pistol.

But what if the pistol is broken in some way? OK, let's say that a bullet should necessarily be fired and that the aim isn't off. Then the glass gets broken.

Can there be a whole in the glass? No there can't be. The bullet hits the damn glass, OK?

OK, and how far is the glass.

Let's say that the bullet hits it with *sufficient* speed. 

Sufficient for what? Now you just defined the situation in such a way that the effect is embedded in the cause.

There may be many possible setups where you will be able to to guess whether the glass gets broken, but this does not make the general principle true. Because there is no general principle, only a mental image. It is no wonder that the causal maxim works best in environments which are based on mental images (or dogmas as we called them before).

On the concept of determinism as the default worldview
===

Sometimes when we perceive new things that we did not expect we adjust out thinking so as to take them into account. But if there is no way to adjust our thinking we just ignore the things that don't fit into our causal chain, as if they do not exist. If there is an event (or even a whole aspect of reality) that does not uphold to causal laws, we would not be merely unable to *make sense* of that event or aspect (as seeing an event without being able to make sense of it would indicate that we can comprehend it it by merely adjusting our thinking), we would not be able perceive the it in any way, even if it happens before our very eyes.

By the same token, a world that does not adhere to laws is impossible to be modelled. Such world does not offer any means for us to be able to predict the outcome of our actions. Therefore, in such a world we would not be able to use mental images, because there would be no way for them to exist at all. 

Assuming that the world is not lawful is simply a dead-end in terms of our thinking. This is why we mostly assume otherwise.

When applied to large-scale thinking, this asumption establishes determinism as the "default" worldview and makes us cautious when facing non-deterministinc phenomema (which we often try to contain them in a system which is inherently deterministic).

In deterministic systems, non-deterministic events can only be explained by "hidden variables" theories. Basically, this means the only reason why you didn't predict something is that you are not good enough and you don't know enough.

> 0. Mental image (or dogmas, as we called it earlier) is a set of many impressions united in order to be perceived as one. 

> 1. Mental images exist only in a causal world - in a world without causality there will be no point nor reason to unite several things and unite them as one.

Mental images have the power to reinforce themselves with time - having the image of `A ⇒  B` in our head, we would see `A`-s and `B`-s all over the place. Even when we search for a new image, we will search for it only in the space which is not occupied by `A`-s and `B`-s so the new image would be supplementary to `A`-s and `B`-s, like a jigsaw puzzle.

Some people think that having the right way to view the world can make you less dogmatic - the reality of it is that *any* worldview makes you dogmatic, except the lack of such.

Mental images are abstractions, they can be used without a loss of precision only when you can keep in mind what are they and from what are they produced from. 

Our stance as humans, however *is not like this* as some of these images are clearly embedded into our minds.

Mental images have scope.

On the concept of the self, the human's desire for control and the enforcement of deterministic subsystems 
===

The idea of God is not merely delusion created to help cope with the fear of death (although it does help people cope with the fear of death), but it is a personification to the aspect of reality that does not adhere to the causality maxim and that is unknowable. Religious rituals can be rationalized using the following argument: although we cannot really be familiar with the aspect of reality which is unknowable, we must pay tribute to it, in order not to forget of its existence.

The idea of the self is probably closer to a delusion than that of God, but it is a personification of that which is knowable - your persona, your job, the things you know and believe are you. Any habit thought or urge that is outside of this narrative is not really a part of the self. And that is not because such habits/thoughts/urges are rare. Neither because they are better, worse or in any way different than the rest of your habits/thoughts/urges. They are not part of the self for precisely that reason - they are not a part the narrative.


The self is not who you are, but who you want to be (your projected goal).

On the true nature of reality 
===

I started the chapter by saying that reality is *perceived* as discrete, or in other words that it is composed of states that are clearly distinguishable from one another in which there are events, which are also discrete. But the above line of thought suggests, the separation of events happens in our brain. Which leads me to believe the separation of frames must come from it too.

According to these assumptions, reality does not have a structure. Rather it is something like eternal ununderstandable blob, which floats constantly from one state to the next, not following any type of pattern. 

Being continous, though, it does not change itself completely every instant. However the way in which one state float into the next must be, by itself, patternless like brownian movement (except that gasses are still composed of discrete particles), and the patterns we see must be imposed by our own brains.

In order to get around it, we humans take pictures of that blob from time to time and then, based on those pictures, we try to interpret it in a way that is structured - we circle one spot of the blob and say "This is `A`". Then we take another picture and search for where `A` went. Or if there are any other instances of `A`. All events which a we withness must be connected with one another forming what is known as a causality chain (or chains). 

An event that does not cause any other event as per their causal chain simply cannot be perceived by us, so in many ways, placing the event in the causal chain is perception itself.

This is why, in our everyday thinking, we often refer to all things that we talk about as either real or unreal (just like in logic we split statements to true and false) e.g. Stephen Hawking is real and Professor Charles Francis Xavier is not. 

This line of thought, however is too naive. To see why, one just has to look at a more abstract concept, e.g. is true love real, and does it exist? It all depends on how you define it, and defining it in too robust terms is impossible, as the definition would rely on many other concepts.

the "realness" of a concept is not just a matter of whether something exist or does not you had or had not seen something which resembles it, but a matter of how much does the concept resonate with the concepts that constitute our worldview. In other words, it is not a yes/no question. The degree of realness, we can also call the degree of *anticipation of perception* i.e. considering an object real means that you anticipate to sense it. Although it seems counter intuitive at first, the anticipation of perseption actually comes *before the perception* - only after we are ready to and prepared to perceive something, we may actually come to realise that it is actually there (this statement may seem paradoxical, but as we said perception itself is paradoxical).

The black hole example is appropriate here. Earlier, we said that the black holes' existence was postulated before actual objects were observed. But does that mean that we are to regard them (before they were actually observed) as absolutely unreal? According to this line of thought no - if the theories that postulate their existence were supported by *some evidence from observation* i.e. there were some way in which these theories fitted into the more general framework of knowledge of the field, then they should be viewed as "somewhat real", as opposed to "imaginary".

Moreover, there are aspects of black holes, which are not yet observed (and some that, are considered *unobservable*). Black holes still might not be exactly what we think they are. Therefore we cannot claim that they (our current notion of them) are 100% real.
