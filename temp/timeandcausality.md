Time is discreet, or at least it is perceived as discreet by us - we can view the *input* which our brain receives and from which the perception of time and continuity is derived as a collection of frames, pictures of different states of reality which are, somehow, united. 

There is no global and universal time clocks imply, only local and subjective time which different brains perceive for themselves.

In order for the perception of time to be realised, the list of frames must be interpreted as signifying some sort of change of object from one state to another, like change of position (motion), change of shape, change color etc.

- But if the frames are all alike (like if you are standing facing a wall) you would not be able to perceive change (and time). 

- But if the frames are all different and don't have anything to do with each other, you also wouldn't be able to perceive change. 

To perceive change, then, your must be able to interpret the frames in such a way that there is an aspect of them which is different for each frame but at the same time stays the same for all of them i.e. to postulate the *identity* of objects and events.

The basic form of identity of events and objects (objects being just collections of events) is *causality* - when observing event `A` in a given frame followed by another event `B` at another frame, we conclude that `B` is caused by `A`. But causality works in somewhat circular manner as `B` is party defined by its internal characteristics and party defined as just "the thing that comes after `A`". 

However, this circular nature of causality is precisely what makes causality work.

Let's imagine that we observe `A` and then observe another event `X` which is caused by it (let's not concentrate on how do we know that `A` is really `A` or that the other event is really caused by it). 

Knowing that `A â‡’ B` we may either presume that `X` is some manifestation of `B` or that `A`is not really `A`. The first kind of thinking is called dogmatic, the second one - empirical.


- If you derive your knowledge about events just by their relations to other events, then all events would be similar to one another, and you would not know anything about any of them. 
- But if you derive knowledge by events only by observed internal characteristics, then each instance would be different and you would not be able to unite different observations into a clear picture.
