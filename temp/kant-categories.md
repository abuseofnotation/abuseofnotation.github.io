The evolutionary perspective
---

A year or two ago, I read a lot of papers and books on the subject of time and how it is human-made concept and I came about to a very interesting idea  which was also inspired by some lectures on biology that I was watching. It's the idea that a one of the key differences between dumb and smart organisms is that smart organisms *think that they know everything* i.e. they view their knowledge as all-encompassing which enables them to use it to reason about the world. I am reprinting the description of this idea from my notes:

> The behavior of the simplest organisms that have no brain or have a very rudimentary brain can be described by the stimulus-reaction model - they perceive an object and react on it immediately in the manner that they are predisposed (with natural selection clearing out inadequate responses). A little more complex, but still fairly simple are organisms that can also judge whether a given reaction was "good" or not (e.g. by using pain detectors) and store in their brain a lot of good stimulus/reaction pairs e.g. seeing a predator and running away. These pairs resemble rudimentary memories but unlike real memories, they don't require for an organism to have concepts of time, causality or any of the other related concepts in order to exist, as these pairs: 
>
> - Do not constitute sequences of actions or events.
> - They are not related to one another in any way i.e. there is no before and after.
>
> Such organisms can also work with concepts (a concept in their case being just a collection of memories that resemble one another), but they are still very simple. For them, the concepts of truth and falsity (if we can call them that) are equivalent to the feelings of pleasure and pain.
>
> More complex are organisms that have the ability (or perhaps it is more correct to say "the ambition") to predict the future. Indeed those are the ones that have a concept of a future and past at all, as the concept of a prediction is the same as that of the future. Predicting the future requires more than just taking stale pictures of things and figuring out what you need to do in case a similar situation arises: it requires the organism to have the concept of a *world* (or of "substance" as it is sometimes called). This can allow organisms to produce images that:
>
> - Have multiple steps that lead toward a common goal.
> - Can be organized in a hierarchy, where one goal can be a step towards a bigger goal.
> - Are self-enforcing (we will say more about that later).
>
> The main difference between the two is different types of knowledge - simple organisms can only have knowledge that has *limited scope*, while more complex ones have knowledge that is *universally valid*. The two types of knowledge correspond to the two types of Aristotelian syllogisms 
>
> - `Some A-s are B` (limited scope)
> - `All A-s are B` (universal) 
>
> We need to think only a little about how those two types of knowledge are acquired to see that, although comparable, they are drastically different from one another:
>
> Simple organism who thinks in terms of statements with *limited scope*, thoughts are only a means for gaining a more favorable feedback from reality, which means that their significance is limited as well e.g. a simple organism that has an apple which is not tasty would be "unhappy" about the sore taste, but it would not ever be unhappy about the *fact that his assertion turned out to be false*. 
>
> A simple organism just abandons an idea, as soon as it feels wrong to it, being wrong does not lower his self-esteem, it does not bring it an existential crisis, nor does it cause it to abandon some other related ideas that it has.
>
> Furthermore, a simple organism would not feel the need to unite several different phenomena that it experiences under one common cause, nor does it feel the need to ponder over why things are the way they are and not some other way (as I do currently). The simple organism is humble - it just does not hope that it can ever know what the things that it says really are and so it does not bother itself with them. 
>
> If they could talk, simple organisms would probably say that they are *wrong by default*, whereas we, because we are "smarter" consider ourselves correct by default.

>4. Statements that have only limited scope can be justified only by *observation* - if I observe two or three objects that I categorize as `A`s (e.g. "apples") and I find that they possess the property `B` (e.g. "tasty"), I can conclude that `Some A-s are B` based on those observations alone i.e. based on my instincts. 
>
>Statements with universal scope, on the other hand, are axiomatic by their nature - they create reality as much as they describe it. My basis for saying `All A-s are B` is not at all different from my basis for saying `Some A-s are B`. What is different is my decision to assume that this piece of knowledge is universal.

Statements like `All A-s are B`, despite the way that beside `A` and `B` such statements reference a third object which I call the world or the *substance* as philosophers call it. Thus, they (we) have the notion of *permanence*. This notion (I talk about this more in my notes) is a prerequisite for the concept of *change* as we know it, because to say that something is changing you must first view it as permanent, otherwise we would perceive everything as just Heraclitian flux.


Kant
---

In one of the best treatments of the subject of time, "The Critique of Pure Reason" Immanuel Kant split the pure concepts of the understanding into four classes called *quantity*, *quality*, *relation* and modality and notably each class contains three categories, instead of two, as most other Kantian taxonomies to.

Quantity 
- Unity 
- Plurality 
- Totality 

Quality
- Reality 
- Negation 
- **Limitation**

Relation
- Inherence and subsistence 
- Causality and dependence 
- **Community**

Modality
- Possibility - Impossibility 
- Existence - Non-existence 
- **Necessity - Contingency**

So what is the third thing, the third member. According to the author, it's a combination of the other two. 

Here is what the author says about the third members of each category:

> II. The number of the categories in each class is always the same, namely, three—a fact which also demands some consideration, because in all other cases division à priori through conceptions is necessarily dichotomy. It is to be added, that the third category in each triad always arises from the combination of the second with the first.
>
> Thus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity; limitation is merely reality conjoined with negation; community is the causality of a substance, reciprocally determining, and determined by other substances; and finally, necessity is nothing but existence, which is given through the possibility itself. Let it not be supposed, however, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not a primitive conception of the pure understanding. For the conjunction of the first and second, in order to produce the third conception, requires a particular function of the understanding, which is by no means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second. Thus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category of totality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude and unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite). Or, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, it does not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how one substance can be the cause of something in another substance, will be understood from that. Thus it is evident that a particular act of the understanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances.

Here I will argue that the third member of each triad of categories is merely the one concept of the world/substance, that enables the kind of thinking that I defined above. 

Quantity 
- Unity (measure) - recognition of a thing as one 
- Plurality (plurality) - recognition of there being several things 
- Totality (whole) - unification of all things (of a given group) as one.
