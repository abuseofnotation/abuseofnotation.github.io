The book "Critique of Pure Reason"


Before we begin
===

Historical context
---

The book starts by introducing two distinctions for all logical statements: for Kant each statement is known either "a priori" or "a posteriori" and is also "analytic" or "synthetic".

A statement is said to be true a priori, if it is not derived in any way from sensory experience. Imagine a mind which exists independently from a body, with no possibility to communicate with the outside world. Everything that this mind can ever know about the world are *a priory* statements (obtained through what Kant calls "pure intuition"). Everything else, all the knowledge that we gain through experience as individuals is *a posteriori*.


The idea of *a priori* statements is as old as philosophy itself with many philosophers believing that we should not trust our senses and that observation is not a valid way of obtaining knowledge. At the time when the Critique was published this view was held by people such as Rene Decartes and Gottfrid Leibniz who were collectively known as rationalists and held some very extravagand (and some ridiculous) theories. Here is a piece by Rene Decartes (the famous "Cogito ergo sum"):

> But I have convinced myself that there is nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something, then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. [From Meditations on First Philosophy]

So in other words, the only thing that we know *a priori* (and therefore the only thing that we know at all) is that we exist.

An opposing view - that we can claim that we know something only if we know it from experience (*a posteriori*) were held by another school of philosophy - the empiricists (Locke, Berkeley, Hume). It is this quote from the latter which made Imanuel Kant write the Critique: 

> It appears that, in single instances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost scrutiny, discover any thing but one event following another, without being able to comprehend any force or power by which the cause operates, or any connexion between it and its supposed effect. The same difficulty occurs in contemplating the operations of mind on body- where we observe the motion of the latter to follow upon the volition of the former, but are not able to observe or conceive the tie which binds together the motion and volition, or the energy by which the mind produces this effect. The authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas is not a whit more comprehensible: So that, upon the whole, there appears not, throughout all nature, any one instance of connexion which is conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them. They seemed conjoined, but never connected. And as we can have no idea of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward sentiment, the necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connexion or force at all, and that these words are absolutely without meaning, when employed either in philosophical reasonings or common life. (David Hume, 1737)

Emanuel Kant's idea was to unite these opposing world views in a cohesive whole. 
What is this book about
---


Before we answer that question we need to introduce another distinction between logical statements. This is the distinction between analytic statements (or tautologies as they are also called) and synthetic statements. Analytic statements are ones which are derived from other statements via logic, for example if we know that "Athinians are mortal and Socrates is an Athenian" we can conclude that "Socrates is mortal." Such statements are called tautologies because the conclusion consist of nothing more than a repetition of what is already known. Analytic statements are, therefore, not very interesting. It is the synthetic statements (so all others) that are the subject the book.

It is obvious that analythic statements are known a priori - I don't need to have any experience with Socrates or Athenians to conclude that if Athenians are mortal and Socrates is an Athenian, then Socrates is mortal - but they can be known a posteriori too - if I happen to know Socrates and I've been there when his famous execution occured, I can can conclude by my personal account that he is mortal. It is equally obvious that the main way to gain synthetic knowledge is a posteriori - through experience. But is it the only way? According to Kant it is not.

The word "Critique" means "a detailed analysis and assessment of something." When we say "pure reason", we mean knowledge about the world which are both synthetic and a priori.

Kant begins his endeavour that such knowledge exists. In other words he asserts that people have real knowledge about the world which they did not perceive from their senses. This type of knowledge, knowledge of synthetic a priori statements about the world, is called transcedental. The concepts of space and time are, for Kant, a prerequisite for such knowledge as are the categories.

The "inner/ourter" world distinction
---

Before continuing with space and time, we should make another important distinction, which again reminiscents of the philosophical dispute between the schools of the empiricists and that of the rationalists. We said that the transcedental knowledge is knowledge of "synthetic a priori statements about *the world*". But what do we mean by *the world* and can we really know something about it for sure? To answer this question, we must make a distinction between objective reality, consisting of "things in themselves", and the image with which this reality manifests itself to us as "phenomena" that we experience (or "sensation"). We saw that rationalists are interested with objects and they do not care so much of how do we perceive them, empiricists think that we cannot know anything unless we perceive it and are interested in how the human mind works. It is possible, however to agree with both by studying both the inner world, of things the way we perceive them and the outer, objective world. Introducing this distinction and talking about the two worlds separately makes things easier and much more precise - instead of wondering what do we actualy know about the world and how valid what we know is, we just say that everything that we ever perceive, and therefore know is true, but only when it relates to the world, as perceived by us, while the objective reality is, by definition, unknown.

And because the only way for us humans to know something is to perceive it, we must begin our quest for *transcedental knowledge* with the notion of *transcedental perception* or as it is also called *transcedental aestetics*. 

On Space
---

The idea of space, along with the idea of time is the only notion that allows us to construct *a priori* *synthetic* statements about the world *as perceived by us*. Here are some arguments about why space is an a priori concept, that is one that is inherent for the human mind: 

* The sence of "uniqueness" of space - the human mind cannot perceive more than one space, more than one universe, therefore the notion of space is a predispositioned one.
* Many statements about *geometry*, are considered undisputedly true, without being proven (for example how do we *know* that the space has three dimensions, or that the sum of two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side). We cannot deduce this from anywhere, and yet they are too universal for us to say that we obtained them from experience.

So space is one of the two things that we know *a priori* about the world *as perceived by us*. But space is more than that - it is the medium that enables perception itself: you can imagine an object void of any of its qualities, but not void of space. For example each object has color but you can imagine an object without its color, or imagine it without its scent. You can even imagine an object without the concept of time, as you do when doing geometry. But you cannot imagine an object without first positioning it in *the* space. Because of this, we may say that space is not only a property of the world *as perceived by us*, but is also somehow a property of the *objective world*. In effect space is the property that binds these two worlds together.

On Time
---

Many, if not most, of the of the things that we said about space can also be said about time. Like space, it is universal and unique - we can only perceive one timeline. Space and time are the two components that shape our reality - space allows objects to co-exist, and time enables their states to form a succession and thus enables change. 

Unlike space, though, time is not in any way connected to the objective world and the notion of one unique timeline is also not objectively true (kudos for Kant for finding that out exactly 124 years before Einstein's theory of special relativity). So time is a human-made concept that does not exist in the objective world. It is however, a very important component of our inner, subjective world and it closely related to the idea of self-perception - without the notion of time the concept of "I" won't exist either, because what is "I" if not the collection of my states throughout my life.

The notion of time allows us to represent ouselves as actors in the world, and the notion of space allows us to perceive that world as observers. If we take space and time, and space and time only, as known *a priori* (and we should as there there are the only two things that can exist without the presupposition of some other object existing) we have a stable philosophical framework.

Transcedental Logic
===

Perception is a necessary condition for obtaining knowledge, however perception does not produce knowledge directly - we obtain knowledge by thinking. 

Thoughts by themselves also don't constitute knowledge. Think for example about the speculations that scientist oftem make, for example about Steven Hoking who theorised the existence of objects, which he called "black holes" as a possible explanation of some cosmological phenomena. Can we say that he *knew* something about the object before the object was observed? No, because no matter how sophisticated his theory was, it was still just a theory, and the theoretical object "black hole" as imagined by Hoking, is a different object that actual black holes that exist, no matter if they are called by the same name and are, in practice, quite similar. 

Now imagine an astronomer who does not know about Hoking's theory but who, through his telescope, sees a black hole (or rather the way in which a black hole messes up the orbits of some planets). He is on the other side - he is perceiving the thing, but he does not have any idea what it is. His observation is useless without a theory that explains it, and a theory is useless if it does not have an application - knowledge = perception + thought.

The science that deals with the way we think is, of course, called *logic*. Logic can be *general* and can be specific to some domain like accounting, biology, football etc. And the general logic, if we are picky we can divide to *pure* and *applied* where the applied part is everything that is related to the human mind as such. 

Pure logic contains just a few fundamentals that we know a priori and are essential to the way we think. Pure logic is, therefore, synonymus with "first order" logic - a fact which is proven (as much as it can be) by Kurt Godel in his "completeness theorem" (not to be confused with the incompleteness theorem). Therefore, these a priori concepts are the concept of a negation, the *AND* and *OR* operators and the "modus ponens" or something like that (there are several flavours of first order logic).

Is pure logic also *transcedental*, in the sense of the word that we used when we talked about transcedental aestetics - a prerequisite for a priori knowledge? Not quite since, as we said earlier, logic does not constitute knowledge - logically correct statements are not necessarily true. Transcendental logic, then, is the study of pure logic *and* its relation to objects. 

But we said that perceptions and thoughts are both essential for aquiring knowledge. So can we talk about *transcedental logic* independently of perceptions? In other words can we think about something without knowing that it exists? The answer is that, we can - we apply the same tactic that Steven Hoking uses to formulate his theories. By saying "Suppose that such and such object exists" or "Let X be such object that". In other words, we can not know anything about a given object until we see it, but we can delay the moment when we perceive it, and thinking about it in advance. The technical names of these perceptions is "functions" - they produce a value, only when given a value or two in advance.

Transcedental Analytics

Transcendental analytic is based on conceptions(functions)

Space and time are a propri aesthetic conceptions, the categories are a priori logic conceptions
Space is our mind's storage facility.)


Synthesis
--- 

We already discussed how our sensibility allow us to perceive all kinds of objects ranging from things that are vital to our survival, such as edges of cliffs, to things which which are quite remote from it, such as black holes. We discussed the mind's thinking apparatus which allows us to build all kinds of theories about our world, both simple and very complex. But how do these things come together. That is to say, how do we take an astrological object that we see in the sky, and a scientific theory and say "this actual object is an instance of this theoretical object". Actually what we say is rather "this whole set of objects are instances of this class", for no theory is made to explain just one object, otherwise it would be quite useless and it will be no theory at all.

This unification of *many* objects, under one concept is what actually unites the our sensibility with our mind's logical facilities, enabling knowledge. The process is called *synthesis* and we can see that it is not objective - it actully is an act of imagination (one person with might argue that no object in the universe fits the description of a black hole completely, while another might find the description matching all kinds of objects which were never intended to be described in Hoking's theory). The process is composed of three stages:

1. Apprehension - a *representation* of an object (phenomenum) is *perceived* by the senses.
2. Reproduction - the *image* of the object (a *picture* if you will) appears in the mind.
3. Recognition - a preexisting *concept* which matches (the image of) the object is found and connected to it.

Note that the process of synthesis is only possible due to our conception of time (as we said previously, time is not objective, but subjective). It allows us to unite different representations that we perceive, which resemble one another, and clasify them as an instances of something which we already know. 


[](
For example colors do not exist - if we examine closely we can find thr no two things are exactly the same color.
We will prove that the conception of cause and effect is not void, e g that there exist an object corresponding to this conception 
Space and time can also be such concepts as color, there can be many spaces and times.)
