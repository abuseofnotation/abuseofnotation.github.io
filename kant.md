title: Booknotes: Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" 
layout: blog
---

Hello there. So lately I've been exploring this book, which I will refer to as simply "The critique" by following the lectures by [Robert Paul Wolff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d__In2PQS60) and decided to put my notes here in case someone finds them useful.

Disclaimer
===

This is a summary. The ideas expressed in it belong to Imannuel Kant ideas. The sentence "Kant thinks" can accompany each sentence from it, but it is ommited for brevity and ease of reading.

This summary is *not exaustive* - I don't claim that *all* ideas in the portion of the book that I am summarising are expressed. 

The summary is also *not objective* - I am interpreting the ideas in the book the way *I* understand them, which may or may not be the way your philosophy professor interprets them.

The summary is *not a substitute of reading the book itself*. Rather my aim was for it to help people who read the book by providing an additional viewpoint into what is happening in it.

Why I am reading this book (not related to the book itself, you can skip it) 
===

One year ago, wandering in an antique bookshop, I found a very well preserved and  pretty-looking little book, which also looked quite interesting. Being fond of manually-printed books I got it partly as a collectible and partly because it was short and looked interesting. The book was called "Critique of *practical* reason" and, as it later turned out, it was the second of Kant's critiques, the first one being the much larger "Critique of *pure* reason". 

After I realising that I bought part two without having part one, I decided to go with it. I purchased the first book which really turned out to be several times longer than the second one and started studying it. I don't know how this story will end and I will update this entry as it progresses, but currently I am still at the middle of the first critique. Life's a journey, right?

Before we begin
===

Philosophy is a strange beast - its position as kind of a middleground between science and, say, literature makes it in some respects harder than both of these disciplines. Unlike novels and scientific paradigms, no philosophical work can be viewed by itself so the only way is deeper into the rabbit hole. Here are some things that you definitely have to know about in order to read this book.

Historical context
---

The book starts by introducing a distinction between two ways in which we obtain knowledge: each statement is known either *a priori* or *a posteriori* (as you will learn, Kant likes to divide stuff in two). A statement is said to be true a priori, if it is not derived in any way from experience. Imagine a mind which exists independently from a body, with no possibility to communicate with the outside world. Everything that this mind can know about the world are *a priory* statements. Everything else, all the knowledge that we gain through experience as individuals is known *a posteriori*.

The idea of *a priori* statements is as old as philosophy itself with many philosophers believing that we should not trust our senses and that observation is not a valid way of obtaining knowledge. At the time when the Critique was published, this view was held by people such as Rene Decartes and Gottfrid Leibniz who were collectively known as rationalists and held some very extravagand (and some ridiculous) theories. 

Here is a piece by Rene Decartes (a variation of the famous "Cogito ergo sum"):

> But I have convinced myself that there is nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something, then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. [From Meditations on First Philosophy]

An opposing view - that we can claim that we know something only if we know it from experience (*a posteriori*) were held by another school of philosophy - the empiricists, represented by Locke, Berkeley and Hume.  It is this quote from the latter which inspired Imanuel Kant to write the Critique:

> It appears that, in single instances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost scrutiny, discover any thing but one event following another, without being able to comprehend any force or power by which the cause operates, or any connexion between it and its supposed effect. The same difficulty occurs in contemplating the operations of mind on body- where we observe the motion of the latter to follow upon the volition of the former, but are not able to observe or conceive the tie which binds together the motion and volition, or the energy by which the mind produces this effect. The authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas is not a whit more comprehensible: So that, upon the whole, there appears not, throughout all nature, any one instance of connexion which is conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them. They seemed conjoined, but never connected. And as we can have no idea of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward sentiment, the necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connexion or force at all, and that these words are absolutely without meaning, when employed either in philosophical reasonings or common life. (David Hume, 1737)

In short, where rationalists placed *religion* and faith, the empiricists placed *science* and observation.

Emanuel Kant's idea was to create a system which unites these opposing views in a cohesive whole, where each of them has its place. He rejects the rationalistic notion that we can know something about the real world just by thinking, but he also argues that experience is not the only source of knowledge. To prove this last point, he ventures to find out how the human mind actually works - what is it that we are *programmed* to know and how valid it is.

What is this book about
---

What exactly is the Critique about? Before we answer that question we need to introduce another distinction between logical statements. This is the distinction between *analytic* statements (or tautologies as they are also called) and *synthetic* statements. Analytic statements are ones which are derived from other statements via logic, for example if we know that "Athinians are mortal and Socrates is an Athenian" we can conclude that "Socrates is mortal." Such statements are called tautologies because the conclusion consist of nothing more than a repetition of what is already known. Analytic statements are, therefore, not very interesting. It is the synthetic statements (i.e. everything else) that are the subject of the book.

It is obvious that analythic statements are known a priori - I don't need to have any experience with Socrates or Athenians to conclude that if Athenians are mortal and Socrates is an Athenian, then Socrates is mortal - but they can be known a posteriori too - if I happen to know Socrates and I've been there when his famous execution occured, I can can conclude by my personal account that he is mortal. It is equally obvious that the main way to gain synthetic knowledge is a posteriori - through experience. But is it the only way? According to Kant it is not.

The word "Critique" means "a detailed analysis and assessment of something." When we say "pure reason", we mean knowledge about the world which are both *synthetic* and *a priori*. Kant begins writing believing that such knowledge exists ( i.e. real knowledge about the world which is not perceived through the senses) and then ventures in an inquiry to *prove* that that is really so. and what are the boundaries and the objective validity of such knowledge.


Transcedental doctrine of elements: Transcedental Aestetics
===

We said that the transcedental knowledge is knowledge of "synthetic a priori statements about *the world*". But what do we mean by *the world* and can we really know something about it for sure? To answer this question, we must make a distinction between objective reality, consisting of "things in themselves", and the image with which this reality manifests itself to us as "phenomena" that we experience (or "sensation"). We saw that rationalists are interested with objects and they do not care so much of how do we perceive them, empiricists think that we cannot know anything unless we perceive it and are interested in how the human mind works. It is possible, however to agree with both by studying both the inner world, of things the way we perceive them and the outer, objective world. Introducing this distinction and talking about the two worlds separately makes things easier and much more precise - instead of wondering what do we actualy know about the world and how valid what we know is, we just say that everything that we ever perceive, and therefore know is true, but only when it relates to the world, as perceived by us, while the objective reality is, by definition, unknown.

And because the only way for us humans to know something is to perceive it, we must begin our quest for *transcedental knowledge* with the notion of *transcedental perception* or as it is also called *transcedental aestetics*. 

On Space
---

The idea of space, along with the idea of time is the only notion that allows us to construct *a priori* *synthetic* statements about the world *as perceived by us*. Here are some arguments about why space is an a priori concept, that is one that is inherent in the human mind: 

* The sence of "uniqueness" of space - the human mind cannot perceive more than one space, more than one universe, therefore the notion of space is a predispositioned one.
* Many statements about *geometry*, are considered undisputedly true, without being proven (for example how do we *know* that the space has three dimensions, or that the sum of two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side). We cannot deduce this from anywhere, and yet they are too universal for us to say that we obtained them from experience.

So space is one of the two things that we know *a priori* about the world *as perceived by us*. But space is more than that - it is the medium that enables perception itself: you can imagine an object void of any of its qualities, but not void of space. For example each object has color but you can imagine an object without its color, or imagine it without its scent. You can even imagine an object without the concept of time, as you do when doing geometry. But you cannot imagine an object without first positioning it in *the* space. Because of this, we may say that space is not only a property of the world *as perceived by us*, but is also somehow a property of the *objective world*. In effect space is the property that binds these two worlds together.

On Time
---

Many, if not most, of the of the things that we said about space can also be said about time. Like space, it is universal and unique - we can only perceive one timeline. Space and time are the two components that shape our reality - space allows objects to co-exist, and time enables their states to form a succession and thus enables change. 

Unlike space, though, time is not in any way connected to the objective world, and the notion of the existence of one unique timeline is also not objectively true (kudos for Kant for finding that out exactly 124 years before Einstein's theory of special relativity). So time is a human-made concept that does not exist in the objective world. It is however, a very important component of our inner, subjective world and it closely related to the idea of self-perception - without the notion of time the concept of the self won't exist either, because what is "I" if not the collection of my states throughout my life.

The notion of time allows us to represent ouselves as actors in the world, and the notion of space allows us to perceive that world as observers. If we take space and time, and space and time only, as known *a priori* (and we should as there there are the only two things that can exist without the presupposition of some other object existing) we have a stable framework for perceiving the world around us.

Transcedental doctrine of elements: Transcedental Logic
===

Perception is a necessary condition for obtaining knowledge, however perception does not produce knowledge directly - we obtain knowledge by thinking. 

Thoughts by themselves also don't constitute knowledge either. Think for example about the speculations that scientist oftem make, for example about Steven Hoking who theorised the existence of objects, which he called "black holes" as a possible explanation of some cosmological phenomena. Can we say that he *knew* something about the object before the object was observed? No, because no matter how sophisticated his theory was, it was still just a theory, and the theoretical object "black hole" as imagined by Hoking, is a different object that actual black holes that exist, no matter if they are called by the same name and are, in practice, quite similar. 

Now imagine an astronomer who does not know about Hoking's theory but who, through his telescope, sees a black hole (or rather the way in which a black hole messes up the orbits of some planets). He is on the other side - he is perceiving the thing, but he does not have any idea what it is. His observation is useless without a theory that explains it, and a theory is useless if it does not have an application. To put that in simpler terms:

> knowledge = perception + thought.

The science that deals with the way we think is, of course, called *logic*. Logic can be *general* and can be *specific to some domain* like accounting, biology, football etc. And the general logic, if we are picky we can divide to *pure* and *applied* where the applied part is everything that is related to the human mind as such. 

Pure logic contains just a few fundamentals that we know a priori and are essential to the way we think. Pure logic is, therefore, synonymus with "first order" logic - a fact which is proven (as much as it can be) by Kurt Godel in his *completeness theorem* (not to be confused with his *incompleteness* theorem). Therefore, these a priori concepts are the concept of a negation, the *AND* and *OR* operators and, of course the *forall... there exists* structure which allow us to define functions.

Is pure logic also *transcedental*, in the sense of the word that we used when we talked about transcedental aestetics - a prerequisite for a priori knowledge? Not quite since, as we said earlier, logic does not constitute knowledge - logically correct statements are not necessarily true. Transcendental logic is, then, not just pure logic but it is pure logic only insofar it is related to objects of sensibility. 

But we said that perceptions and thoughts are both essential for aquiring knowledge. But can we talk about *transcedental logic* independently of perceptions? In other words can we make logical assertions about an object in the real world,  without sensibility i.e. without first perceiving the object? The answer to that question is that we can. We just have to apply the same tactic that Steven Hoking uses to formulate his theories. By saying "Suppose that such and such object exists" or "Let X be such object that". In other words, we can not know anything about a given object until we see it, but we can delay the moment when we perceive it, and thinking about it in advance. The technical names of these perceptions is "functions" - they produce a value, only when given a value in advance.

> Suppose that I had a body which ran on a liquid substance that were distributed to its limbs by a series of tubes. 
> Suppose further that there were other beings (which I will call "bears") posseing, as part of their bodies, sharp objects that are capable of tearing these tubes out, thus spilling the substance. 
> -----
> If that were so, then I would try to avoid being in a close proximity with these bears.

By the way, I am not following the systematic structure of the book closely, simply because the structure is way to complicated for me to do that in such a short resume.

Transcedental Analytic: Analytic of concepts

Of the transcedental guide for the discovery of all pure concepts for the understanding
---

If we use functions to abstract away all objects of experience in our thought, we will discover that each *judgement* (or statement as it is also called) that we make has four main characteristics, with three different ways to clasify the statement for each of those characteristics: 

Quantity - What are the objects that the statement is valid for?
- Universal: *for all*
- Particular: *there exists A*
- Singular: *there exist unique A*

Quality - What do we state about the object or objects?
- Affirmative: *A is B*
- Negative: *A is not B*
- Infinite: *A is non-B* (the distinction between this and the negative statement has been problematic).

Relation - If our statement is a *composite* what are the parts that it is composed of and how do they stant against one another (concerns combining several statements into one)?
- Categorical: *P* (no relation)
- Hypothetical: *if A then P*
- Disjunctive: *either P or Q*
 
Modality - Is the statement *true* (This is the only characteristic that has nothing to do with the content of the statement but with its connection to the real world)?
- Problematic: *possibly P* (we do not claim that P is true).
- Assertoric: *P* (we claim that P is true).
- Apodictic: *necessarily P* (P is necessarily true, like an axion).

So for example the statement: 

> There *necessarily* exist a *unique* A such that A *is* Boris Marinov.

is an *categorical*, *apodictic*, *singular*, *affirmative* statement.


We already discussed how our sensibility allow us to perceive all kinds of objects, using the a priori concepts of *space* and *time*. We discussed the mind's thinking apparatus which allows us to build all kinds of theories about our world, both simple and very complex. But how do these things come together. That is to say, how do we take an astrological object that we see in the sky, and a scientific theory and say "this actual object is an instance of this theoretical object". 

The key is that theories, rarely talk about "*this object*" - they actually say "this *set of objects* are instances of this class". Scientific theories are a type of *concepts* 



Of the deduction of pure concepts for the understanding
---

When we look at the organs of sensibility we can almost feel which of them are a priori, however with reason, things are not that intuitive. That is why it isn't enough just to state the categories - we must proove that they are indeed valid. In order to do that, we must examine more closely the process we called *synthesis*

Synthesis
--- 


This unification of *many* objects, under one concept is what actually unites the our sensibility with our mind's logical facilities, enabling knowledge. The process is called *synthesis* and we can see that it is not objective - it actully is an act of imagination (one person with might argue that no object in the universe fits the description of a black hole completely, while another might find the description matching all kinds of objects which were never intended to be described in Hoking's theory). The process is composed of three stages:

1. Apprehension - a *representation* of an object (phenomenum) is *perceived* by the senses.
2. Reproduction - the *image* of the object (a *picture* if you will) appears in the mind.
3. Recognition - a preexisting *concept* which matches (the image of) the object is found and connected to it.

Note that the process of synthesis is only possible due to our conception of time (as we said previously, time is not objective, but subjective). Time allows us to unite different representations that we perceive, which resemble one anotherin some respect, and clasify them as an instances of something which we already know. By viewing time in the way that we defined it (as the form of our inner sensibility) we solve the age-old paradox related to the person who passes the same river twice: 

*Problem:* If we are strict enough (as we are, if we are interested in philosophy) we cannot justify and make sense of the identity of an external object. That is if yesterday I cross at a river which is on my way, and then on the next day go to the same place and cross a river again, I cannot really say that I crossed the same river as before - neither is the river the same as it were yesterday, nor am I.

*Solution:* The connection between the river I crossed yesterday and the one I crossed today is actually pretty simple - both were crossed by *me*, and I decided to perceive them as one and the same river, based on my perceptions and logic. Furthermore I too can be the same person as I was yesterday - only thing I have to do is *remember* yesterday. It is my memories - the placing of my perceptions on the temporal scale that make up my personality and my world.

The solution might appear quite anticlimatic at first, but it is quite exciting once you realise that accepting it means that all rules for making sense of the world are subjective. It almost seems that the whole world that we are experiencing is made up in our minds. 

[](
For example colors do not exist - if we examine closely we can find thr no two things are exactly the same color.
We will prove that the conception of cause and effect is not void, e g that there exist an object corresponding to this conception 
Space and time can also be such concepts as color, there can be many spaces and times.)
