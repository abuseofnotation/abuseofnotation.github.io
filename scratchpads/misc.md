Hokusai
---

I consider Hokusai the greatest artist of all time, because he contributed to the two most prominent genres in visual art  - landscapes and porn.

Notes
---
Keeping notes is a good idea if you want a very large quantity of mediocre ideas.

Tutorials
---
Unpopular opinion: Art and writing tutorials that teach you how to find your audience, and say that commitment is the most important thing about art and that if you write/draw every day you would create great stuff etc. are fake, stupid and self-serving and they are part of the reason why 99% of all art is boring, mediocre and useless.

Simplicity
---
I am getting weary people's almost religious devotion to simplicity and briefness. "Use simpler language" "Can't you say the same thing in fewer words?" Well, if I say it with fewer and simpler words, it won't be the same thing, would it? What if I am crazy and I believe that all that matters? If the practice of summing human knowledge into short and accessible sentences worked, then everyone today would be brainiacs. And you are free to decide on your own to what extend that is true

Impressing others
---
Don't try to impress others - they don't care.


The people
---
Nobody cares about the average person's opinion, but everyone is deeply concerned what "the people" think.

Genius/idiot
---

Doing math leaves me feeling like a genius 10% of the time and like a complete idiot for the other 90%.


Learning programming
---
When learning #programming itâ€™s important to write a lot of code and also to read a lot of code. Writing is to understand you are retarded and reading is to understand everyone else is retarded as well.

Code comments
---

Types of code comments by how useful they are:

3 Comments that literary describe what the code does: `// Check if the user has 18 years`

2 Comments that summarize the way a given function is intended to be used `// Checks if the user is eligible for an account and throws an error if they aren't`

1  Comments that make fun of colleagues and their mess ups: `// Bill is a complete idiot that indexes in his objects start with 0 other than one, so we have to check for this here every time`


Conway's game of life and the halting problem
---

Conway's Game of Life" is the perfect setup for understanding the Halting Problem: 

Given a pattern and a seed, producing an non-terminating sequence and the question, "Is this pattern a part of the sequence?"  you cannot always answer that question. 

If the answer is "No" you have to check the whole sequence and you cannot do that because it's endless

If the answer is "Yes", you can easily check it just as you can easily diagnose some issues with your code, but you cannot be sure it works.
