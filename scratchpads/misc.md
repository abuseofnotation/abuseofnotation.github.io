Time and money
---

Time is not money - you can convert time to money, but not the other way around.


How artists settle
---

When an artist stops experimenting and settles for a specific type of content and aesthetics, critics say that it is because they “matured” and “found their voice”, “developed a unique style” etc.

AFAIK, in most cases it’s because they lost their inspiration, became lazy, and decided to only do low effort remixes if the project that sells best. 

And the reason why critics (both professional and self-proclaimed) and regular consumers like settled artists so much is because it make THEIR job easier - why get into a new thing every time and wonder how to react, when you could be just reading variations of the same old thing over and over again.


Normal and non-normal people
---

Viewing people as merely normal and non-normal is like viewing drinks as alcoholic and non-alcoholic.


The point of life
---

- I am so confused! If only I knew what is the point of my life!
- Well it’s relative, but it probably has to do with being good, making a positive impact for the people around us, doing meaningful work having meaningful relationships etc.
- Nah, I am pretty sure that’s not it.


Genius/idiot
---

Doing math leaves me feeling like a genius 10% of the time and like a complete idiot for the other 90%.

Learning programming
---
When learning programming it’s important to write a lot of code and also to read a lot of code. Writing is to understand you are retarded and reading is to understand everyone else is retarded as well.

Code comments
---

Types of code comments by how useful they are:

3 Comments that literary describe what the code does: `// Check if the user has 18 years`

2 Comments that summarize the way a given function is intended to be used `// Checks if the user is eligible for an account and throws an error if they aren't`

1  Comments that make fun of colleagues and their mess ups: `// Bill is a complete idiot that indexes in his objects start with 0 other than one, so we have to check for this here every time`

Cars
---
It’s amazing how oblivious people are to how dangerous and harmful cars are to people - any life-threatening thing in the city, such as an hanging cable, open vent etc is big news. Cars - people get murdered every day and they don’t even report it.

Banality of evil
---
I think that the principle of the banality of evil is also valid in the other way around: not only that evil is banal, but all banal things are evil (i.e. banal <=> evil)

Inspiration
---
The only legit way to combat the writer's block and lack of inspiration that I have discovered: take a hour off, leave your work in front of you and start start reading some random book, or doing something else entirely, untill something in what you are reading/doing reminds you of your work.

Hokusai
---

I consider Hokusai the greatest artist of all time, because he contributed to the two most prominent genres in visual art  - landscapes and porn.

Notes
---
Keeping notes is a good idea if you want a very large quantity of mediocre ideas.

Writing Tutorials
---
Unpopular opinion: Art and writing tutorials that teach you how to find your audience, and say that commitment is the most important thing about art and that if you write/draw every day you would create great stuff etc. are fake, stupid and self-serving and they are part of the reason why 99% of all art is boring, mediocre and useless.

I think I will write a writing tutorial about how you should not listen to writing tutorials. Oh, wait...

Simplicity
---
I am getting weary people's almost religious devotion to simplicity and briefness. "Use simpler language" "Can't you say the same thing in fewer words?" Well, if I say it with fewer and simpler words, it won't be the same thing, would it? What if I am crazy and I believe that all that matters? If the practice of summing human knowledge into short and accessible sentences worked, then everyone today would be brainiacs. And you are free to decide on your own to what extend that is true

Impressing others
---
Don't try to impress others - they don't care.


The people
---
Nobody cares about the average person's opinion, but everyone is deeply concerned what "the people" think.
