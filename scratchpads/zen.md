Worthwhile
---

The main challenge for me when it comes to spirituality is to be able to feel worthwhile without seeking approval from anyone, and at the same time not to attach any importance to myself.

Dichotomies
---

The mind separates the world in dichotomies, because it is unable to perceive it as a whole. #zen #zenschool

Natural state of affairs
---

All ideologies and paradigms claim to represent the real and the natural state of affairs.

They do not.

If it is real, why do I have to read a 1000 book to perceive it (is God incapable of being brief?)

If it is natural, why is it so hard for me to understand it?

Our real nature springs from within, and it is smarter and more powerful than any artificially-created doctrine. The only way to overcome it is to knock that doctrine in our heads 24/7. And so that is what our society does.

Signs
---
The concept of asking for a sign that what are you doing is good is a manifestation of peoples desire  to succumb to authority. Don't wait for signs!

Identity
---

People who identify themselves by their weaknesses - that is endless pain for no reason.

People who identify themselves by their achievements may feel better from time to time, but would be equally miserable in the long run.

Zen adepts only identify themselves with the whole world, because that is the most truthful representation of them. 

Fear
---
We do things the wrong way because we are too insecure to believe that we can do them right.

We hurt people because we don't believe that we can love them and they can love us back. 

We lie because we don't believe we are able to tell the truth in a compelling way.

We cheat because we don't believe we are good enough to succeed while maintaining our honesty.

We insist on our point because we are afraid of the consequences of us admitting that we are wrong.

I think that we do all these things while concentrating at what are we gaining, but we never think of what we are losing, cause if we were, we just wouldn't. Cause it's clearly better to be friendless than to be an abuser, it's clearly better to be hated than to be a fraud. And it is clearly better to correct youself when you are wrong, than to keep doing the same old thing.


The way
---
The striving is the goal.

The effort is it's own realization.
The beginning is the end.
The Way is the aim.

The list
---
All our worries in life boil down to not being able to tick all items in the list of things that society has told us we should do: 

- Get rich
- Have children
- Be successful professionally
- Visit this and that location, have this and that thing.
- Be liked by everyone
...

Being happy and content is not an item in this list, it is the act of erazing the list.


Dreams
---
Think about a dream.

What you are imagining is probably unachievable for many reasons, but don't think of it like that, think of it as having many different manifestations, some of which are detached from reality.

Then try to find other manifestations of you dream and ,by doing that, bring it closer and closer to your normal everyday activities, so close that every effort you do towards achieving it, even the thought of how to achieve it is it's (the dream's) realization.

The division between dreams and reality, between what we want and what we can have is a division between brain representations and actual states of affairs. It is a sign that the dream is rudimentary, e.g. the dream of driving a sport car with a beautiful guy or gall and a bag of cash on the back seat is rudimentary and therefore unattainable just by its inner inconsistensies (e.g. sport cars don't have back seats). To realize it, we need to understand what it really represents, to make it ours
