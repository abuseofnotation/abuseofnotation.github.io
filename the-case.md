The case of "The case". Everything I know about writing and why did I spent 7 years to write a 27000-word novella.
===

Today I finished the first part of my first self-published novella which I had started writing 7 years ago, at the age of 25 (I am 32 now if you are too lazy to do the math). I am not a fast writer, but I can still write the same amount of words in a few months, so why did it took me so long? It can say that either something in this book wasn't my cup of tea, or that I had experienced a severe case of the writer's block, but, as you'd see, the story is much more complicated than any of these explanations would suggest.

Let's begin at the beginning. Seven years ago, I was a somewhat promising young author - I had published a couple of short stories, I had a blog and I had made some attempts at writing longer fiction which some people were encouraging. One of the people I looked up to was Stephen King. I did not want to copy his style, but I wanted to be like him, read hugely sucessful, prolific and loved by everyone. Last but not least, I also wanted to have and interesting and challenging profession. So I followed his advice, contained in the book [On Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing:_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft) (which I still think is great) and set out to write my first great novel. 

As I started, my protagonist was going to be a version of me which would also look a bit like Sherlock Holmes (my attempts to picture myself as Jesus and Faust were hugely unsuccessfull) and the story was also going to be similar, except it would be in the future where crimes would usually be solved by computer alghorithms, which would provide the moral conflict for the story and allow me to include some interesting thoughts on the topic of technology, which was an old interest of mine. In short, my premise was perfect - my protagonist was a brilliant detective as I thought about myself as a brilliant writer. In the book, he was going to show the world how brilliant he was and I was going to show the world how brilliant *I* was by writing it. 

> "But I haven't done anything illegal, and nowadays the false flags are very rare. So why are you here then? The next most probable explanation is that you are looking for help. But this is not a standard practice. So to do it you must be in very senior positions, possibly even C-level. That would explain your age too, as most of the people who work with you are pretty young. I admit that my last proposition was a bit fuzzy," he continued after a while, "so you can easily question its validity. You may, for instance, say "But no one has killed anyone in this city for years" and you will be right. You may say that there is a huge unsolved crime from just a week ago, and your remark will be valid. Still, it is my firm conviction that there is only one kind of crime that can cause such radical alteration of your way of doing things. Only one kind of crime that can lead the leaders of one of the biggest organisations in this city in my humble office. And apparently, at least when it comes to our current situation, I was correct.

I dedicated a lot of effort to the project, but the more I was progressing, the more I felt that the plot wasn't going anywhere. My character was not discovering anything about the case that he was hired for and he was also not as brilliant as I was imagining him to be, and (what was even scarier, for a 25-year-old) not that different from everyone else and characteristic. Also my character lacked motivation, which was probably because my own motivation as a writer was depleted: during the time when I was writing that book I had started my first full-time job and also gained some insight on how the publishing world works and with that came the obvious realisation that my talent was not a ticket for a pleasant and a care-free living, as I had thought previously, but even the other way around. But I still kept on writing, as all writing guides advised me to do.
At some point in his career, Arthur Conan Doyle started hating writing about Sherlock Holmes. He even tried to "kill" him in one of his stories (only to revive him later due to public interest). He hated writing about him because he felt that his character was too rudimentary. At the stage of my life I was tired of *myself* in the same way - I felt as a one-dimensional character in the film about my life and that didn't help my writing. At one point the mantra that writing is what I loved, so I had to keep doing it stopped working because I no longer liked writting and I no longer could do it, even if I wanted to, not to mention that the topic of my novella at the time was my love for my hobby, so writing it without feeling satisfied felt *immoral* as well as impossible. I didn't yet had the writer's block but I got something even worse from a productivity standpoint - I would open my draft and would start deleting stuff from it, because it all felt too fake.

> "Look, if you want me to help, I need to-"

> "My friend," Pankill interrupted him, "there are over two million people under our jurisdiction, here are around two hundred of us, and the unsolved crimes are two or three per month. We no doubt have our imperfections, but believe me, we don't need help, nor do we plan to alter our approach. Quite the opposite - you too, if you work at our scale, will have to follow it. So from now on just accept this thing here," Pankill pointed to the PC, "as your partner."

My inability to be productive helped me realise once more how much I really liked writing - I felt like shit when I was not doing it. But still when reading my text, it seemed to me that my character wasn't being honest with the people around him as to who he was, as I wasn't being honest with myself - I wasn't a careerist. I wasn't really a conflict-free person who always knew what he loved to do. And I did not write just because I loved writing - I actually wanted to be famous simply because I was insecure about myself.

My initial impulse was to embed this layer of insecurity that I was experiencing *in my character*. making him a brilliant person who was *secretly insecure*. This was my initial impulse because that is how I felt about myself at that time. I figured that removing my character from his piedestal and making him a real person would make him more relatable for both myself and my potential readers, thus killing birds with one stone.

> "I didn't want to be mediocre," Ayer spoke fast and stopped only to take a sip from the cup of Cappucino that Vince had brought him. "I wanted everything I do to be perfect, but at the same time I had no idea what that meant and how could I achieve it. As a result, I missed most of my youth. I was apathetic - I went to study in a university after finishing school, because that's what everybody did, I worked the job that my father had arranged for me because it was the easiest thing I could do. I spent my free time reading books and I thought that this was making me better than everyone else, actually, it was more like the opposite," Ayer was smiling as he was speaking, "Although, to be fair, it helped me immensely."

> "Now when you speak about your job, you are referring to the dry-cleaning place where you met Robert?" 

However that did not work out. It did not fit into my narrative and as much as I admit it, and despite my best attempts, it was still dishonest. But I felt I was onto something - at least my new writings were relatable, by myself at least.

My next plan was to change the genre of the book and center it entirely on my main character's personality - it wasn't going to be pulp-fiction any more, but an abstract revelation about finding myself, with many alegories. So with an ability to attack problems which is probably one of the few really positive qualities that I posess, I set out to examine my novel, as my protagonist examines his suspects, and find the seed for version 2.0. My efforts to do that were *not* successful. As many people do, I was only searching for myself at places where the answer that I would find would be rewarding and the transition to the new state - effortless. I imagined that my inner self would be a perfect attachment to my persona and discovering it would enable me to say "Yeah, of course" and to continue writing the narrative that was my life with one dimension added to the protagonist. But I found nothing, like a person who when searching for a rhynoserous goes to his room and opens the first drawer and when not finding what he seeks, opens then the second drawer. No, you cannot find a rhynoserous without leaving your home. In order to find a rhynoserous (yes, I know that the mephaphor is a bit weird but please bear with me) you have to go to the jungle, risk your life, learn about things which you did not think you'd know and, not least, prepare to face it. 

And while I was getting ready to do so, my real persona was watching me through my pages.

> She sat upright, with her toes touching the floor with a posture that made her look like she was about to attack him. Both her toes and her nails were painted with dark nail polish - perhaps to hide signs of biting, but the layer was so thick that he couldn't be sure. She looked like she was about twenty, but she was dressed and made up as a much older woman, indeed, the level of sophistication of her wardrobe was unlike what he had seen by people her age. Perhaps this was a way for her to show character or exactly the opposite - to conceal her character from him. If the latter was true, she was doing a perfect job of it - the amount traits she managed to hide from him was astounding. This was probably the smallest he'd ever known for a living person in a long while. He looked at her and smiled while trying to relax himself with the fact that it was probably her race that prevented him from seeing a clearer picture of her.

This was where my true writer's block began. Opening my editor was scary and depressing at the same time. I tried to write some stupid blog posts but I failed again, which felt even more depressing. Some of you are probably thinking why didn't I drop this whole project which weren't going to bring me anything and on which I was not working on anyway. Or what is this mythical "writer's block" anyways, and why is there a special name for it, when it is clear that you can encounter the same feeling when you practice any other activity - when you have been a lawyer for twenty years and you suddenly feel appaled by everything that is related to your profession, you don't say that you have the "lawyer's block" and be all whiny about it, but you just move on to something else. The answer to that question is simple - my novella contained stuff that was *personal* to myself, so scraping it would mean scraping myself, and I wasn't quite ready to commit suicide.

Faced with the writer's block, many writers make an attempt to write against their will, which for me is unexplainable. I imagine they do that because they still feel that what they say might be important to someone, (eventhough it apparently is not too important to themselves). Or maybe this is just an excuse for not wanting to get better, both as writers and as people. We all tend to like stick that "me" label to all kinds of shitty sets of believes, and keep it there as a manifestation of our freedom to define our own individuality. We rarely get rid of old habits, even ones which kill us, simply because we are too attached. And because we don't like to admit our weaknesses, we dress them in pretty clothes and claim that they are part of us. This is where the main source of the writer's block comes from - from an internal conflict. It is basically one side of your personality which wants to write and another which sees no point in doing so. You might think that this conflict is is normal and also valuable for the reader, but it is not - a conflict, by itself is not valuable - its resolution is. And if you are strong enough to model your values and your whole personality with the power of your will into whatever you like, why don't you model it in a way that is beautiful, in a way that is conflict-free, and in a way that makes sense for you and other people (the keyword here is "other people", as a person who is alone does not have personality)? 

Such conflicts are generally not too hard to see - mine was that I was desperate for the attention and approval of other people at one hand, but I also was (and always had been) an elitist, who did not care about other people on another (the secret aim of some of my earlier writings was to feed my ego and to establish me as some of these people whom everyone respected and with which noone can argue with). I wanted to write a bestseller which were also very deep and idiosyncratic, which cannot happen. In order to finish my book, I just had to chose what was it going to be like.


> He kept thinking why had he lied to her at the end. Or perhaps the real question was rather why he contemplated on telling her the truth, as opposed to what he did to all people who's behaviour he couldn't diagnose with a faily high level of accuracy. Perhaps it was because what he felt towards her was quite different from what he felt to the other members of that group - while everyone else in it were in some sense *alien* to him, Den was there because she was, in many ways,  *similar* to himself. As him, she was a foreigner to her environment. As him (and her sister), she chose to live without technologies. And she probably did it for the same reason as he did - because she still had hope for a world which was not completely soulless. He wanted to be close to her, but at the same time her behaviour was scary for him, as if she was exposing to him, his own self with weaknesses which he didn't know he posessed.

I don't know how and when exactly did the next period again, but I can say for sure that it was the slowest of them all - appauled by my narcisisstic personality which had started this idiotic book in a way to gather attention, I started divorcing from many of the aspects which had prevented me from finishing the said book. While doing so, I discovered that there indeed were things in that text which I genuinely wanted to say to other people (not only things which I thought that they wanted to hear.
I was almost ready to finish my book. There were just one thing that I was missing - my voice. I was at a good place *internally*, but I wasn't sure how to express what I wanted to say, *externally*. That was really a problem for me, although, as you'd imagine, I have long stopped worrying about me not being able to finish my book.


> He went through the list of future occupations like a poker player going through his cards. His speculative abilities made him feel like he could visualise how he will spend his life if he went with each of them. As if all he needed to do is ask himself, say, "How would I feel if I decide to have a family?" and he could already see the double bed. He saw his wife decorating the living room, he could  feel the thoughts running through his head when he was looking after his child. He could see everything, and everything seemed perfect. There was, however one problem - he did not feel any enthusiasm, about doing any of these things. He wasn't feeling enthusiastic about his freedon. And without enthusiasm (he realized that just then) the sparks of light which came from good experiences would never be enough to compensate for the eternal darkness which everything consisted of.

> And then just as he felt that there isn't a right or even a semi-right thing that he could do, a thought crossed his mind that was so novel and unexpected that it sounded like it was coming from another person:

> "How do you like your old life back. How do you like to be a detective?"

> "But may abilities may have gone for good," he thought to himself but the voice didn't stop.

> "So what? It is not like most people have any abilities to begin with. If you will be choosing a life, it makes much sense to choose a life which you know well, and your own life is a good option."

> "But that life it wasn't really my own."

> "Yeah, but it is the closest you have. Plus you know full well it's as good as any other."

> "Look, there is no value in reinventing your persona to start a new and end up in the same old situation. The only way for a life to be your own is for you to keep making it your own."

A good book should be more than a description of someones trauma. A good book should allow me to overcome the said trauma, to rise above it in some way. More importantly, a good book is not the product of some idiot who sits behing his laptop thinking "I want to write a good book". It is something you pay for, not only with your time and effort, but by sacrificing part of yourself in the process. Each person envisions himself in a certain way, which is very apparent from the way he relates to everything around him. Writing is all about *changing* that perception, and *mostly* about giving up on some of it. When you are stuck, the reason is probably because you haven't given up enough. 


And there is one takeaway from all this. From first glance it looks like the authors of bestsellers and in general people who adapt easily are the ones who care about other people, and people like Marcel Proust, the individualists, rebels do not, but actually its the other way arounnd.
