[Finitely Generated Modules Over a PID](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/finitely-generated-modules-over-a-pid)
---

Math3ma --- 12/12/2020

We know what it means to have a module $M$ over a (commutative, say) ring $R$. We also know that if our ring $R$ is actually a field, our module becomes a vector space. But what happens if $R$ is "merely" a PID? Answer: A lot. Today we'll look at a...

---

Math3ma --- 10/15/2020

Galois Theory is all about symmetry. So, perhaps not surprisingly, symmetries found among the roots of polynomials (via Galois theory) are closely related to symmetries of polygons in the plane (via geometry). In fact, the two are highly analogous!

Math3ma --- 2/7/2020

After some exposure to group theory, you quickly learn that when trying to prove a group $G$ is abelian, checking if $xy=yx$ for arbitrary $x,y$ in $G$ is not always the most efficient - or helpful! - tactic. Here is a (not comprehensive) running...

Perhaps you've heard of Évariste Galois? (Pronounced "GAL-wah.") You know, the French mathematician who died tragically in 1832 in a duel at the tender age of 20? (Supposedly over a girl! C'est romantique, n'est-ce pas?) Well, today we're taking a...

Math3ma --- 9/11/2018

There are two definitions of absolute continuity out there. One refers to an absolutely continuous function and the other to an absolutely continuous measure. And although the definitions appear unrelated, they are in fact very much related, linked...

One day while doing a computation on the board in front of my students, I accidentally wrote 1 + 1 = 1. (No idea why.) Student: Um, don't you mean 1 + 1 = 2? Me (embarrassed): Oh right, thanks. [Erases mistake. Pauses.] Wait. Is there a universe in...

Math3ma --- 9/11/2018

Love and Math by Edward Frenkel is an excellent book about the hidden beauty and elegance of mathematics. It is primarily about Frenkel’s work on the Langlands Program (a sort of grand unified theory of mathematics) and its recent connections to...

Math3ma --- 9/11/2018

Not too long ago, my college-algebra students and I were chatting about graphing polynomials. At one point during our lesson, I quickly drew a smooth, wavy curve on the board and asked, "How many roots would a polynomial with this graph have? Five?...

---

Math3ma --- 9/11/2018

Last time we proved that the pseudo-hyperbolic metric on the unit disc in ℂ is indeed a metric. In today’s post, we use this fact to verify Lindelöf’s inequality which says, "Hey! Want to apply Schwarz's Lemma but don't know if your function fixes...


[Loading a Cabal module in the GHC API](https://alternativebit.fr/posts/haskell/cabal-ghc-api/)
---

AlternativeBit --- 8/8/2018

If you plan to build some Haskell tooling or any kind of static code analyzer, chances are you’ll need to use the GHC API at some point. While loading a simple module into GHC’s API is quite trivial and well documented, loading complex modules...

TL;DR I use 4 Perl Regex patterns most of the time when it comes to search some Haskell code: Functions:    "\b\b[ \t\n]+::" Types:        "(data|newtype|type)(\ +)\b\b" TypeClasses:  "class(\ +)(.*)(=>)*(\ *)\b\b" Constructors: "\|[\t\ ]+\b\b" I...

AlternativeBit --- 11/29/2017

TL;DR In this post, we describe how we can use partially applied functions as a design building block though the study of a practical example: the bracket function. I’ll use the Haskell programming language to illustrate this post. Just keep in...

AlternativeBit --- 10/21/2017

I have been watching Jessica’s Mak streams lately. She is an indie game developper, but most of all, she has a kick ass overlay that shows what she is typing in real time. I wanted the same one, I made it using Haskell, Gloss and Chipmunk via the...

AlternativeBit --- 4/4/2017

Exercise P.221 Is the order in which we call bracket and handle important? Yup, it is pretty important: the code executed during the in-between statement of bracket still can raise an exception. We do not want our application to crash in case of an...
