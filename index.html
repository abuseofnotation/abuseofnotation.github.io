<div class="hello">
  <p>Hello, </p>
  <p>My name is Boris Marinov and I am 30 years old.</p>
  <p>I like to think of myself as an artist, but you'd probably say that I am more of a "software guy".</p>
  <p>I <a href="http://github.com/boris-marinov"> write code </a> (I am a fan of functional programming).</p>
  <p>I used to fiddle with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Evolutionfonts/" target="_blank">design and typography </a>, but I came to realize that I like simplicity more.
  </p>
  <p>Also, I am writing <a href="https://boris-marinov.gitbooks.io/the-case/content/" target="_blank">novel</a>. You shoud *totally* check it out.</p>
  <p>I have a lot of other interests that you probably don't care about.</p>
  <p>You have a project that you think I might enjoy and/or find challenging? I am already interested.
  <a href="mailto:marinovboris@gmail.com">Tell me about it</a>.</p>
  <p>Here is a more <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cv">official-looking CV </a> </p>
