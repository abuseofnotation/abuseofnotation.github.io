WebAppDev Consulting
===

Hello, I am Bobby and I provide consulting for software development of web-based applications (in short "web-app dev")

You can hire me for both small and big projects, both short and long consulting session. I can code, write documentation, create wireframes, write tech specs, communicate with customers, develop strategies. Or we can discuss which one of these things you need.

Here are some of the services I offer:

Market research
===

So you have a great idea about a (web) application. Good, but are there some similar products out there in the market? Are there enough people who can potentially use your app? And if no, then is there a way to make your app applicable to a bigger group? How would you make enough money to sustain your business? I am ready to help you answer these questions.

Technology assessment
===

You are confident about your idea and you have already decided that you are doing it. Now the question is how? Should you write it in some new language like Go or Closure, or use the good-old Java. You have heard that Ruby would get you to version 1 very fast, however node.js allows you to use one language for both the front-end and back-end. Speaking of the front-end, perhaps we should also use some of those frameworks, like React or Angular? Or not? Those are very important questions, that I can help you with.

Business analysis
===

Perhaps your application is in production, and you are wondering why aren't more people using it? Perhaps something is stopping their workflow? Or they are missing features? But which of their countless feature requests are important and which are not? Which are cheap to implement and which are not? Is it possible to solve many issues at once? Or perhaps the answer is not to build more, but to drop some features that don't bring value in order to concentrate on the ones that are important? Whatever the approach is, I am ready to help you find it.

UI/UX
==

You decided to build a feature, not the question becomes how should it look like? Where should it sit in the app? What should it be called, and what should it say on the labels and buttons? Should you use a dropdown, an autocomplete field, or a dropdown-autocomplete? Should you have all the data for it on one screen, or have some kind of wizard? I dealt with such questions many times and I know how to find the right answers.

Technical Specs
===

Now after all has all been decided, regarding a given app or a feature, it's time to put it on paper. Writing tech specs is the central practice of software development, so you SHOULD have good tech specs. But, creating them requires familiarity with everything that I talked above as well as everything that I will talk below. Here the questions that arise are more and much more complex than the ones listed above. A good tech spec (e.g. one written by me) leaves none of them unanswered.

Programming
===

The implementation of the tech spec involves programming, which involves knowledge of algorithms, design patterns and many other things. I won't go into detail, but programming is my official job title for most of my career, so I can help you with that as well. For more info, check my [Github](https://github.com/abuseofnotation/).

Design
===

You probably have a lot of people with opinions on what colour should the app be (or which font, which UI library etc.) however, this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to design. "Design is not how it looks, design is how it works" as someone said. Contact me if you want an app that is accessible, that work on a variety of resolutions and devices, that is intuitive (saving you work on the next section).

Technical communication
===

After you app or feature is finally done, the time comes to communicate what it does to various audiences: 
* Communicate to *clients* what the app does so they decide if they need it (your marketing documents would be much better if they contain an accurate description of your program's capabilities, then some vague "marketing talk"). 
* Communicate to your users how exactly can they perform a given task. 
* Communicate to your partners how they can integrate their apps with yours. 

This can be done as text, graphics, videos, interactive tutorials, popups inside your app and with many other even more innovative ways.

I have reasonable rates and I am opened for all kings of offers, contact me at marinovboris@protonmail.com.
