Some mathy-programmy people tell me they want to test their code, but struggle to get set up with a testing framework. I suspect it’s due to a mix of: There are too many choices with a blank slate. Making slightly wrong choices early on causes...

Math3ma --- 2/7/2020

After some exposure to group theory, you quickly learn that when trying to prove a group $G$ is abelian, checking if $xy=yx$ for arbitrary $x,y$ in $G$ is not always the most efficient - or helpful! - tactic. Here is a (not comprehensive) running...

Math ∩ Programming --- 4/24/2013

For a list of all the posts on Category Theory, see the Main Content page. It is time for us to formally define what a category is, to see a wealth of examples. In our next post we’ll see how the definitions laid out here translate to programming...


[Categories, What's the Point?](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/04/16/categories-whats-the-point/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 4/16/2013

Perhaps primarily due to the prominence of monads in the Haskell programming language, programmers are often curious about category theory. Proponents of Haskell and other functional languages can put category-theoretic concepts on a pedestal or in...


[Probabilistic Bounds — A Primer](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/04/15/probabilistic-bounds-a-primer/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 4/15/2013

Probabilistic arguments are a key tool for the analysis of algorithms in machine learning theory and probability theory. They also assume a prominent role in the analysis of randomized and streaming algorithms, where one imposes a restriction on...

Math ∩ Programming --- 4/8/2013

In this post we will assume the reader has a passing familiarity with some of the basic concepts of functional programming (the map, fold, and filter functions). We introduce these topics in our Racket primer, but the average reader will understand...


[Homology Theory — A Primer](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/04/03/homology-theory-a-primer/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 4/3/2013

This series on topology has been long and hard, but we’re are quickly approaching the topics where we can actually write programs. For this and the next post on homology, the most important background we will need is a solid foundation in linear...


[Conditional (Partitioned) Probability — A Primer](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/03/28/conditional-partitioned-probability-a-primer/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 3/28/2013

One of the main areas of difficulty in elementary probability, and one that requires the highest levels of scrutiny and rigor, is conditional probability. The ideas are simple enough: that we assign probabilities relative to the occurrence of some...


[Methods of Proof — Induction](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/03/21/methods-of-proof-induction/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 3/21/2013

In this final post on the basic four methods of proof (but perhaps not our last post on proof methods), we consider the proof by induction. Proving Statements About All Natural Numbers Induction comes in many flavors, but the goal never changes. We...

The Problem with Cropping Every programmer or graphic designer with some web development experience can attest to the fact that finding good images that have an exactly specified size is a pain. Since the dimensions of the sought picture are...


[Methods of Proof — Contradiction](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/02/28/methods-of-proof-contradiction/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 2/28/2013

In this post we’ll expand our toolbox of proof techniques by adding the proof by contradiction. We’ll also expand on our knowledge of functions on sets, and tackle our first nontrivial theorem: that there is more than one kind of...

---

Math ∩ Programming --- 2/4/2013

A common problem in machine learning is to take some kind of data and break it up into “clumps” that best reflect how the data is structured. A set of points which are all collectively close to each other should be in the same clump. A simple...


[Depth- and Breadth-First Search](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/01/22/depth-and-breadth-first-search/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 1/22/2013

The graph is among the most common data structures in computer science, and it’s unsurprising that a staggeringly large amount of time has been dedicated to developing algorithms on graphs. Indeed, many problems in areas ranging from sociology,...

---

Math ∩ Programming --- 1/12/2013

Being part of the subject of algebraic topology, this post assumes the reader has read our previous primers on both topology and group theory. As a warning to the reader, it is more advanced than most of the math presented on this blog, and it is...


[Probability Theory — A Primer](https://www.jeremykun.com/2013/01/04/probability-theory-a-primer/)
---

Math ∩ Programming --- 1/4/2013

It is a wonder that we have yet to officially write about probability theory on this blog. Probability theory underlies a huge portion of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistics, and a number of our future posts will rely on the...

Math ∩ Programming --- 5/27/2012

In our last primer we saw the Fourier series, which flushed out the notion that a periodic function can be represented as an infinite series of sines and cosines. While this is fine and dandy, and quite a powerful tool, it does not suffice for the...

Math ∩ Programming --- 7/5/2011

“Solution”: Let $ a=b \neq 0$. Then $ a^2 = ab$, and $ a^2 – b^2 = ab – b^2$. Factoring gives us $ (a+b)(a-b) = b(a-b)$. Canceling both sides, we have $ a+b = b$, but remember that $ a = b$, so $ 2b = b$. Since $ b$ is nonzero, we may divide both...
