If $X$ and $Y$ are normed vector spaces, a linear map $T:X\to Y$ is said to be bounded if $\|T\|< \infty$ where $$\|T\|=\sup_{\underset{x\neq 0}{x\in X}}\left\{\frac{|T(x)|}{|x|}\right\}.$$ (Note that $|T(x)|$ is the norm in $Y$ whereas $|x|$ is...

Let a group $G$ act on a set $X$. The action is said to be transitive if for any two $x,y\in X$ there is a $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot x=y$. This is equivalent to saying there is an $x\in X$ such that $\text{orb}(x)=X$, i.e. there is exactly one...
